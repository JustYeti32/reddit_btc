The moment they named the coin ( NXS ) i placed the order on Binance but after 15 minutes i still did´nt had the coins in my portofoli , and the time i placed the order the NXS was allready @ 140 % . Rised to ( what i could see ) 250% and felt down to 150% in seconds. So i knew i was lucky that i could cancel the NXS order and made no losses. At the time i bought the NXS at 140% it was around 1,40 Euro a coin , and a litle later only 100% , and i guess this happens to all those who are scammed this way .

Never again will i do this ever again , now i know how this piramid scam works and those who want to try it, begin with only 10 Euro /dollar to see what happen and you´ll never try it again i promise. They say they put their ´ whales ´ in to create ´ Waves´ , but in reality their whales are their own members . On that moment i saw around 39 Million market/24H whick was 30 minutes later only 30 Million. The only people who win in this are the people at top that bought this coin before, let their ´ whales ´ do the wave, and sell their own coins after a couple of minutes.

I feel sorry for the OP , i tried it to only check out what this scam is but my heart breaks if i see someone lost money on that piramid scams . Be strong OP , and i have respect for your braveness to talk about it here to warn other peoples who want to try."

>  
>There’s \~128B DOGE out there so that’s a daily inflation rate of what 0.01%? So 3.65% per annum?

So it's 128.8b doge with 10,000 created per minute, that works out to 5.24b per year or a little over 4% pa.

Since the rate at which coins are generated is fixed the inflation rate will trend toward 0% over time, however when created it was presumed that this would be countered by the rate at which coins are lost in dead wallets.

By comparison BTC has a supply capped at 21 million, current supply is 18.6 million and 6.25 bitcoins are created every 10 minutes... I'm not sure how you got to 1.75% inflation for BTC but that is incorrect, perhaps that was the inflation rate at inception (I can't be bothered to work it out).

This also halves every four years so in 2024 it will be 3 bitcoins every 10 minutes before hitting zero in 2028.

>That’s really not a crazy rate. Btc which is fixed is like 1.75% annually?

It's a fairly crazy rate, especially considering that 128.8b doge are not in circulation. It was intended to stay at a crazily high effective rate because some portion of the supply would inevitably not be in circulation.

If you account for the tens of billions of doge thrown away because it's a joke currency and the tens of billions more in a few doge-lord wallets then the coins in circulation, and the effective rate of inflation of adding 10,000 more per minute, is considerably higher.

This is by design, it is how the currency was meant to play out. Doge is, and was always intended to be, a terrible store of value.

>My only big concern with doge are the whales who hold it but I guess that’s an issue that concerns them more than me. Gl selling much of it without tanking the market

If you are holding doge them tanking the market should probably concern you... although they will likely use trading software to get rid of this slowly over time rather than dump it in one go.

Some of those big wallets are probably also just exchange cold storage wallets."

If you’re converting from FIAT using a debit card you should be able to transfer funds off pretty much immediately from Coinbase, however the fees are slightly higher.(verification time varies a lot, but you can try both options)

* Buy BTC/Litecoin/etc on Coinbase
* Send it to your Binance account
* Use Binance to convert to Doge

Well 10k DOGE/block is the current reward, and there are no more reward halvings in it's future so it makes the calculation pretty easy.

There are 525600 minutes in a year, give or take. There are 10k DOGE being minted every minute through block rewards.

He said it during his first ever live stream on Clubhouse tonight. It was scheduled for 10pm PST. 

Incase anyone is unclear... it was not intended as a low blow to Doge by Elon Musk when he said “... fate loves and often, the most ironic outcome is most likely, or I like to say the most entertaining outcome is often most likely. Arguably, the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the currency of Earth in the future.”

He is saying the irony is that Doge was created as a joke toward cryptocurrency, yet here we are changing the world into cryptocurrency because of it. Irony is when a situation is opposite of what is expected, and sometimes it is strangely amusing or so incredible that it is nearly unbelievable. Example: A fire station burns down. Fire stations shouldn’t burn down, just like joke cryptocoins shouldn’t become the cryptocurrency of the world. What Elon is saying is that the most unlikely thing to happen... usually is the very thing that does! So where does fate fit in? A few ways...

Fate meaning something that will inevitably happen; Fate is thought to determine the outcome of a situation, most times catching us by surprise usually because of the odds of it happening. Fate such as the hedge funds being overthrown by those who don’t agree only a select few be allowed to hoard huge profits. Or cryptocurrency taking down the dollar. Or decentralizing banking systems, controlled finances and centralized authority.

“Fate loves Irony” meaning fate and irony when presented together will combine the most unforeseen and unbelievable outcome. Decentralization & Cryptocurrency is our fate, the irony is that it will be accomplished through Dogecoin which was intentionally created to make fun of these concepts. Elon Musk is promoting Doge when he says “Fate loves irony...” he mentions he also use to make jokes about Bitcoin. Musk can also be quoted saying, “Who controls the memes, controls the Universe.”
https://twitter.com/btcization/status/1356126052326592514?s=21

Our fate is in our hands... literally! The irony is it’s with a cryptocoin that shouldn’t have value and now does. Put it together and shoot for the moon... it’s what Elon would do! But just a word to the wise...

“Fate loves Irony... but hates hypocrisy.”  So don’t become the people we are trying to overthrow and evolve from. 

Memes + Irony + Fate - Hypocrisy =

Bitcoin, from day one, allowed sizable op-codes, this allowed for apps like Counter Party to have ""second layer"" smart contracts that settled to Bitcoin. Bitcoin Core (Blockstream) saw this as a threat to their ""second layer as a service"" model they wanted to sell so reduced the size of the op-codes allowed AND artificially limited the block size to 1mb. This broke the value proposition of Counter Party and put them out of business. 

Because of this people like Vitalic had no choice but to build an entire seperate block chain in parallel to Bitcoin. Ethereum should have NEVER had to exists, it ALL could have been built on top of Bitcoin and should have been. AND, it still can be. 

Bitcoin as FAST and CHEAP protocol layer still makes sense. What doesn't make sense is Bitcoin as ""settlement, sToR3 oF vALuE token"" for LN and Liquid. 

You are simply wrong to think that Counter Party is not a viable competitor to Ethereum, the ONLY problem is that we are not 10 years behind because Blockstream has been so successful in hijacking the project and brain washing new users such as yourself."

But big financials companies and banks in India will most likely still be allowed to handle all cryptos for themselves. Indian government concern was to see people from low/middle class becoming rich, which is unacceptable culturally. Only the elites must stay the elites.

I spent a little bit time in India, and I can fully certify that casts still exist as of right now! Cryptos were a way for normal income people to become more rich or wealthy, and it was not acceptable, that's the hidden side of the story. I saw that with 2 co-owners of a patent from 2 different casts on a biotech process. To have the permission to exprot the technology, the one from the lower cast had to sell to his associate his rights to the patent. Then his former associate could cash in a x7 when selling it afterwards, few hours later. That's how it worked, and I was a witness of that."

I use BCH and it works absolutely great for me.  I also have BTC and ETH.  But i never use BTC because unless i want to wait a week for a txn to confirm, i have to put in $5 fees....

BCH and BTC are completely two valid experiments that deserve to run.

XRP can be bought while using a reliable Proxy Vpn (use fast connection outside of US) from top 9 markets it is traded in:

We should pick something literally worth pennies and promote the shit out of it. Thats why I keep saying doge. Its on Robinhood which is one of the biggest means of trading now and it will only grow. Plus if any of the things on WSB get shutdown by the FCC or legislation is passed something like altcoins arent a bad hedge. Especially if it is already a low point of entry. If we get enough folks from WSB on the same train we could make this shit blow up like bitcoin in a relatively short amount of time

Theres just no way to know the timing. 

Whales are patient. Very very patient. They likely spent a year or more accumulating DOGE, maybe two... I'd have to look at the charts. It was dormant and low volume low priced for months and months prior to their volume spike to draw attention. 

During those months they didn't buy up all the DOGE they could. They used bots like CAT Tradings software, do microbuys, 24 hours a day. 

Small tiny purchases, small buy orders under market. Get the coins cheap. Dont raise volume. Dont push the price up. That takes discipline. 

But the portions of the coins they did sell at 8.8 cents. They want those back. There is no reason why they cant do it at 30 cents next time. Investors are throwing money at everything. Influx of cash into crypto will be mayhem for pumps like these down the road."

1. Out of all the coins you listed, doge has the most circulation and is used the most. Ripple is constantly facing SEC lawsuit and is on the verge of collapse, I can see stellar competing in terms of widespread use but only time will tell. 

2. Doge won’t be hitting $1 anytime soon, but even at 0.15-0.2, thats a low transaction fee and that goes with the streamer point as well. It makes more sense to deal with more units of the coin per transaction. Also people tip streamers hundreds to thousands of dollars all the time, never underestimate the power of Simps. When DOGE hits $1, fiat currencies will long be inflated beyond belief, there buying power changes."

It is simple as that - no one can tell you if it will raise. Why I am sticking with ADA is that I think it is a good competitor to a Blockchain tech where 1 coin is in the 4 figure range. Also cardano has some interesting projects coming in... get inspiration on Reddit by people who have some reasons for their statements and then do your own research.

When Elon made that post about wanting to give it his full support but wouldn’t due to too much concentration, that told me the man was serious. I think he feels Doge is his responsibility now and he’s not going to let it die. I traded about $4000 worth of BTC for it. I have another $12,000 I’m willing to trade over if it falls a whole lot more in the short term.

I think a $70b market cap is a fair price for doge with Elon behind the wheel. We’ll see how serious he still is when it gets that high... imagine Tesla accepting doge. Doge could rebrand. He might air commercials for it. Tesla charging stations might accept on chain doge transfers. Who knows. If stuff like that is going on... $500b wouldn’t be out of the question in 5 years or so.

Note : we buy and hold SHA to take it to a better place. We are not sellers!

New places will be added soon Just let us know which time zone you guys are from

It will only raise up If we all spend 50$ each on the crypto that will be better We should do our works too by 3 people pushing it will never go up so let's do this together!!

The people dont understand that the SHA has amazing potential. We can make it together higher order by order. What is buy sell buy sell buy sell. If you want to have good profit, you have to buy and hodl!

I dont want to buy cheap and and sell if it is high. P... d ... is not our way

I want to make only the SHA stronger for all

We must to make it stable and than step by step higher

SHA is for long profit and not fast gains

Let share this together

SHA🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Please share 💰💰💰💰💰"

$AMP actually serves a purpose and solves a problem in the world of crypto. Exclusive contract with NCR (which is one of the largest credit card processing systems in the United States possibly world) under the Flexa Network for transaction processing of crypto. It's basically the Visa/Mastercard of the crypto world. The technology is used as collateral against purchases made with crypto. The technology is already being used in over 40,000 retailers including Dunkin Donuts, GameStop, Nordstrom and Lowe's to name a few. Also retailers will be so much more happy when more people are using cryptocurrency for purchases through the flex and network because it's going to keep them from paying the 3% transaction fees that go along with people purchasing with credit cards.

It's only on Gemini for right now, but the fact that Gemini (which is owned by the Winklevoss twins), runs it's transactions through the Flexa network, shows that they trust the technology to insure transactions. 

This is a retirement fund investment. If your looking for a long haul run, this is the one to get into."

I definitely understand and appreciate the intention to educate and help guide people, especially those new to investing and cryptocurrency.  I often forget that not everyone does do their research as they should before putting money into the market. 

Admittedly, yours is not the first post with a similar sentiment, I unfollowed the cryptocurrency subreddit because of their wall of anti-DOGE posts.  I understand the risk associated with my investment and know full well this could go terribly, but I also have a portfolio designed to absorb my riskier investments should things go wrong. 

That being said, you have a great point, not everyone thinks that way, nor do people understand what they're buying into.

I genuinely am sorry for popping off at you the way I did.  I had no reason to be as aggressive as I was. I hope your day is going much better than mine was earlier."

Now what I'd like to see is some diamond 💎hand developers jump in, build a bridge to ether blockchain and start a defi pool so we can really create a banking defi system for Doge holders.  Update this and let's get a community of blockchain developers to join in on the doge revolution.  

Also wouldn't mind seeing an improvement of newly mined goge tokens, tapered off a bit.  Or create some sort of hard cap at a trillion coins.  This was meant to be a digital currency for tipping that remained inflationary to keep the price at bay.  

I say we can eat up the supply and increase it to $1.  Which is... tipping type of money.  Let's  goooo!!!

- Get free Nano from a [faucet](https://nanolinks.info/#faucets-free-nano)

Done :)

---

As for Nano fundamentals, here's a starting point:

- No inflation

- Fully distributed

- More decentralized

- Minimal operating costs

- No block rewards

- No miner dumping

- No fees to leech value from transactions

- Still usable above >7 TPS

- Deterministic finality (vs Bitcoin's probabilistic finality)

- Environmentally friendly: no externalities that someone else is paying for

- Asymmetric risk-reward ratio

- Low current market cap

- Also usable as an method of exchange (i.e. directly spendable) - that means that early whales won't all have to ""cash out"" to take profits, they really could use it for goods/services directly

- SoV+MoE > SoV

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

Now take bitcoin and those giant miners pools. If they decide to hardfork they hardfork, simple as that and maybe I'm wrong but I also call this a ""centralized"" project.

Fork in the road: Cardano is currently in the process of it's fork

Meta for k: A few things here.

1a. 'K' is a universal 'meta'-language that allows you to describe the semantics of another programming language and then, over time, it can be used to build all your tooling in the 'K' language

1b. 'K' has been in development for decades and it wouldn't be unreasonable to think Elon is partially familiar with it considering he was still doing a lot of coding back in the 90s, and he may even have a serious interest in it because of the benefits it provides

2. At the end of the Goguen implementation the use cases for 'meta'data on chain will be wide open and the storage/use of 'meta'data on chain is one of the major offerings of Cardano

3. Cardano is not going through the typical soft or hard fork, it is literally neither a soft nor hard fork, it is a meta fork.

So as you can see the ""meta for k"" thing was playing on a handful of things

TL;DR: Elon is absolutely trolling/memeing about Cardano and the only reason to think otherwise would be a lack of understanding as it relates to the technical side of Cardano"

Xrp is also a security and being sued by the SEC and most exchanges delisted them already. If you buy now, you could lose every penny when the SEC shut it down. Xrp is created out of thin air, not mined like bitcoin or dogecoin and the criminal owners held trillions in which they can cash out at any time, pocketing billions. They paid many banks in Japan and others to use their XRP in order to pump up their prices but got caught by the SEC. We would be nervous to have such criminal holding so much power in the world.

I noticed you dropped 28 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

Which leads us to an average of \~21.5 P/S, a decent average, with a lot of growth potential. 

In your table, you also take the average, with huge outliers inside your data. Assuming a normal distribution, with some confidence for your provided data and trimming by 21% top and bottom, we arrive at a P/S average of 87.12. Boom. Taking your data, and instead applying a median, we arrive at a P/S of 66.46, which sounds about right because the harmonic mean is at 66.89 (which should be the number to use for that kind of stuff). Which is more accurate than the 188 P/S average. Still, we can get a better estimate than that.

Let's take a look at your data again. If we calculate percentiles to gauge how skewed data is, it get's interesting: 

Percentile, Value

0.95           975,937

0.90           452.266

0.80           261.016

0.20           20.254

0.10           9.344

0.05           6.219

Damn. Bottom data is more or less ok, the percentile value doubles as we go from 0.05 to 0.10 to 0.20, suggesting a lower bottom bias and missing data. From 0.8 to 0.9 to 0.95 there is also a doubling! This may indicate a top heavy bias. So let's change that, by eliminating, always starting from the full data and the above percentiles.

Eliminating top and bottom 0.05, we arrive at at median of 66.46, harmonic mean at 65.99, average at 117.22. 

Eliminating top and bottom 0.10, we arrive at a median of 63.41, harmonic mean at 58.75, avarage at 92.32.

Eliminating top and bottom 0.2, we arrive at a media of 66.46 (!), harmonic mean at 65.49 (!), average at 76.44.

I think we got something here. So your data suggesting a P/S of 65.49.

My data has a median of 20.1, a harmonic mean of 15.27, and a average of 21.5.

If we assume that 20% (Paretto) of existing Sentinel/Velocity users convert to paying users, that would be 30k users, then with the cVPN it would be 35k. How much does a VPN cost? According to [https://www.techradar.com/vpn/cheapest-vpn](https://www.techradar.com/vpn/cheapest-vpn) (2021, most used and recommended ones), most VPNs start at \~$2.5/month, with a two-year commitment, otherwise the average is \~$4.5, sometimes more. If we add all this up we get an Estimated Annual Revenue of $1,890,000. If there is still a price war to get cheaper we can expect an absolute minimum of $1.5M in the first year once they go into launch? Maybe.

So if we go by the DeFi average (21.5), Sentinel comes in at a diluted market cap of $32.25M to $40.64M, with estimated revenue of $1.5M to $1.89M. That throws the price per SENT to 0.01617c to 0.02032c. So the absolute minimum, using very conservative figures and the average, there is an ROI here of up to 100%! Potentially even much more if they can establish themselves in the market and continue to scale. The desire for privacy is becoming stronger and stronger, and traditional VPNs are increasingly losing trust or have very high price expectations for comparatively few features. There is great potential here. 

Let's check out the harmonics tho. With the DeFi harmonic mean P/S of 15.27, we land a $22.91M cap at $1.5M revenue. Which is pretty similiar to the current market cap of $21.6M. I interpret it as a already priced in evaluation and the floor of the price. So anything lower than 0.01145c is like a private IPO or something like that. There is a cap of $28.86M cap at $1.89M revenue, which is 0.01443c.

With the dApp harmonic mean P/S of 65.49, we have a $98.24M cap at $1.5M revenue with 0.04912c per SENT, or a whooping $123.78M cap at $1.89M revenue, landing a 0.06189c per SENT. A ROI of 500 to 600% according to your data.

Final thougts. Do not even consider selling at 0.01617c to 0.02032c, unless you need to make quick money. I think that once we reach this, there might a a correction and further evaluation period until it turns up and soars like the DeFi or other crypto and web3 markets.

Sounds nice eh? Well... that’s a loooooooong way off. Attainable, yes. But mathematically it’s going to take LOTS of cash to get us there. More than this Sub has combined.( approx. $125 bn to reach a $1 ) Don’t necessarily invite a million people to this sub, but recruit folks you know, get on Twitter and meme the fuck outta it, harass Elon to buy some Doge.

A decade is 10 years right? Have you ever wondered how much DOGE would be minted in that time?

Well 10k DOGE/block is the current reward, and there are no more reward halvings in it's future so it makes the calculation pretty easy.

There are 525600 minutes in a year, give or take. There are 10k DOGE being minted every minute through block rewards.

(10 * 525,600) * 10,000 = 52,560,000,000

I just know there is free advice on YouTube, none of this secretive “newsletter” bullshit. I just know there is a lot of hype and it’s not that easy. And it depends on risk to reward as well. It’s all speculation. For example today a couple stories came about a young man who came up with a theory on how to create fusion energy. Now if it works this will be a game changer for planet earth. Amazon backed this kid as well as Bill Gates. So I did some research into this and it’s a big if. A lot of this technology has not been dreamed up as of yet. So it’s like anything else, it’s 50/50. That’s the safest way I find. But you have to account for fees and everything else. Just research everything. Best example I have was the weed stocks in Canada. You would figure they would go through the roof. But they tanked hard. Educate is all I can give you."

I've been obsessively researching the last few weeks and playing the trading game with small volume of various cryptos, while trying to get my feet wet.  Trading is a rush while Wise seems like literally the wise long game.  I've been impressed with what appears to be transparency from the Wise group.  I decided to stake for a year and to see what happens.  With what seems like 100's of options to learn and invest into, this has been a dizzying experience in trying to understand and chase the next great thing.  Bitcoin feels out of range for my expectations, but I like Wise being backed with the ETH pool and there appears to be only upside and limited downside in this investment, especially compared to everything else I've been researching.  I'm feeling comfortable with my decision on staking here and hopeful for the best.  I really like that the token is only a few months old and it's fun to daydream about what it may look like when it matures like some of these other impressive winners.  Just my two cents from a new investor."

It doesn't take much to ride bitcoin, but a few weeks ago for 1k you could have bought 20+ odd shares of gme which at current value is $2766+, where you could pull your original investment back out and ride for free.
