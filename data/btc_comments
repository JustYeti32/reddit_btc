After all these years, you still haven't understood that this is part of how consensus is reached outside of the software to come up with rules that most participants will agree too and mine for? People try to influence those decisions any way they can and in the end it's simple game theory, a conservative approach (in the sense preservation of your own self-interests) is the essence of it and will always prevail... This has nothing to do with a ""default"" decision, it's calculated. Bitcoin's consensus also becomes highly incompatible with frequent forks when there are more than 2-3 self-appointed ""benevolent"" dictators running the show (that's the *title* Amaury used to describe himself).

You're actually wrong, people are discussing and arguing all the time in the dev mailing list, but they are grown up, they don't throw their toys and threaten to leave every time there is disagreement... BCH devs might be inspired try this, so business might be interested in building on their chain.

> Furthermore, Core almost never adds new features so it makes since you wouldnt see much argument about boring maintenance.

The most important features for the future of Bitcoin you've seen added to BCH, like Schnorr signatures, are coming straight from Bitcoin developers' work. But keep telling to yourself that increasing the blocksize and reinventing colored coins was a great achievement for BCH devs.

> Fake Satoshi and a dictator that wants to arbitrarily award himself 8% of the block subsidy....obviously people we're better off without.

And you've never asked one second why they have targeted your favorite coin... and not Bitcoin (well they tried... but to no avail, they were cast away without requiring forks, unlike on BCH). It's funny how you're talking about lack of self-awareness all the time, I think this is called projection.

A cryptocurrency will generally depend on one or the other system to confirm transactions, but not both. I think there may be hybrids out there but they are very unusual.

But how do you even detect such dishonesty? The only known reliable way for a decentralised network to eliminate dishonesty is actually mining, so that is exactly what was so good about mining, is that it solved that problem. So for a proof-of-stake coin to actually work, it needs an assist from some proof of something more, something much like proof-of-work, the very system it is allegedly competent enough to replace!

It's easy to see that now but back then, Facebook was lagging behind at 3rd place, while Friendster was #1 and MySpace was #2. Unfortunately, I don't have special powers. What I can do, however, is using certain information to extrapolate forward what is likely to happen.

So what are those information?

If you ever used Friendster during that period, you may realize that at a certain point, their site took much longer to render. They can't scale and user experience became really bad. You had to wait 1 minute for the webpage to even show up. Even though Friendster had the largest network effect of all 3 social network platforms, they gradually declined over the years. You don't hear much about them anymore today.

MySpace and Facebook was better in its user experience and MySpace was doing really well. So how did they lose to Facebook?

In my opinion, I think the reason boils down to how Facebook opened up their platform and lower the barrier and empowered anyone to create applications on its platform. This means that instead of Facebook's small team trying to build stuff, they made it so that anyone can become a developer easily on their platform. Suddenly, people started building games and all the other stuff on Facebook (which attracted more users to Facebook and that attracts even more developers). Suddenly, Facebook has few million developers, building stuff without salary, for Facebook's users. It took MySpace few months to catch up to this but even so, they already lost the lead to Facebook.

Bitcoin with their horrible user experience and high fees is like Friendster and they will inevitably lose their spot. I think more developers and businesses need to be aware that they can build smart contracts on Bitcoin Cash easily today using CashScript and other tools. A good place to start is https://developer.bitcoin.com/

Users can easily mint tokens on Bitcoin Cash today for their business ideas and creativity. And if you're a darknet vendor, you want to use Bitcoin Cash's CashFusion for better privacy and anonymity. These empower users and I think it's great, though probably we can keep doing more. We still have work to do for sure.

I'm also going to publicly say, just as I had done so for Friendster/MySpace/Facebook, I will extrapolate (based on existing information) that Bitcoin Cash will take the number 1 position eventually. Sometimes, markets take longer to price things correctly, but they will almost always happen eventually."

Vocabulary:

""script validated"" tokens are a token implemented by the blockchain's programming language.  ETH has ""script validated"" tokens.  The CashTokens proposal is ""script validated"".

""First class"" tokens means tokens that are ""native"" and behave like BCH.  Their ""tokenness"" is enforced directly by blockchain consensus.  No script needed.   The Group Tokens proposal are first class tokens.  (The term ""first class"" comes from language design -- ""first class functions"" means functions with all the same properties as variables (pass them, return them, assign to a variable)).

""miner validated"" is therefore both of these types.

And for completeness, SLP is ""client validated"" -- you can put invalid SLP transactions on the blockchain, but clients are supposed to detect and ignore them.

> (-) Narrow focus, can't be used to solve all smart contract problems

The idea here would be to use smart contracts to solve smart contract problems and tokens to solve token problems, and a hybrid to make tokens with smart contracts.  I don't know if this is really a ""con""; its a design decision to compartmentalize functionality.

> (-) Programming model, re. statefulness and side-effects (jtoomim). Why is this a problem? Is this philosophical or could it have far-reaching practical consequences?

I don't think any proposal is suggesting changing this model.  All proposals use just the data that is currently used to validate transactions (the tx itself and previous UTXOs being spent).

 > Having too good tokens will displace BCH

Your reasons are good.  But there's also the fact that you pay tx fees in BCH, and moving BCH is slightly more efficient in terms of transaction size (you don't need to specify the token id).  

And finally and I think most importantly there's the simple social reason that in this community we wish wasn't the case but is amply proven by BTC's continued dominance in the crypto space while lacking scalability and features.  

A token that competes with BCH would have to be MUCH MUCH better to displace the native ""first mover on this blockchain"": BCH.  But since the token is contained within the same blockchain, it simply can't be functionally better, it can only be equal or more constrained.

And any token that adds value by ""attaching"" to the real world simultaneously adds counterparty risk and known and unknown systemic risks (like fiat currencies have uncertain inflation schedules), so they are a very different beast than cryptocurrencies.  In other words, if you think fiat-token issued by some central bank is going to replace BCH then you don't really understand the value of cryptocurrencies, you just understand the UX part of blockchains.  The fiat token will absolutely be USEFUL, for example for people that need to reduce risk by holding assets in the same currency as liabilities... but that's different than replacing.

So without being attached to an external value source, can a token be ""better"" than BCH?  Well, another way to think about it is that one can only start with something equal to BCH (a first class token) and then add a smart contract to it.  But these smart contracts are also called ""constraint scripts"" and for good reason.  They can only add CONSTRAINTS to spending.  Intuitively, its likely impossible to come up with something more useful and more general purpose by adding constraints."

What technologies has BCH developed  surrounding scaling besides just raising the block size?  I mean is there some upgrade that makes scaling happen besides changing that number, you know like special code or technology that isnt just raising the block size.  Im no dev, but there has to be problems associated with big block propagation, latency, things like that.  So has there been upgrades to the code that address potential probems.
If there has, what is stopping BTC from using those upgrades if ever BCH poses a threaT?

Well I can'treally discuss or debate things that may or may not happen in the future.  Nor can you for that matter.

However,  we can say for 100% sure that 0 sat/byte transactions should definitely be the norm on bch right now and since inception given there is almost no demand for the empty blocks.  The network can easily facilitate that yet the people that control bch don't seem to be interested in offering this to its users.  Given this track record, I'd say that's it's extremely unlikely that you will be seeing sub 1 sat/byte transactions on bch.

This part shows that, **at this point in time**, the full node teams have communicated and think the same. It's not authorative.

Note the emphasis, no one is dictating what BCH should or shouldn't do, but clarity and signals matter. This is the full nodes making their opinion clear. Not authorative.

> no proposals have been published that would seek to change consensus rules for this upgrade.

This part is just informative to show that, again, doing nothing is not a decision to stop or prevent anyone. Maybe kind of authorative? If anyone know of a proposal to push a change into consensus for the May upgrade, let me know. As far as I know, no such proposal exist.

> This is a result of a shared view that changes to consensus should not be rushed to meet arbitrary dates, but instead should be well developed, researched and tested. Furthermore, they should already be in consensus among all relevant stakeholders before making a commitment to activate such changes on the network.

and this part simply enforces the very sane expectation that **should** anyone come forward with a proposal to change consensus for May, then they have a lot to prove in a very short time. Still not authorative.


So I don't see where the ""speaking on behalf of the network"" is coming from, except for maybe that it has the bitcoin cash logo on the statement. If that is all it takes to call someone a bad actor though..

Oh well. The intent behind the statement was to get ahead of the usual ""BCH is going to split"" drama.  I think this statement served that purpose well.

BTC currently processes 3.4tx/s with 1.5mb blocks, while BCH does 3.8tx/s with 1mb blocks (7 day average). Back when BCH was doing much less than that, people like you where saying when BCH gets as many transactions as BTC it would be as expensive to transact as BTC. That hasn't happened, BCH transactions are still 0.1 cents while BTCs are $10.

Due to the higher efficiency of BCH (2.2tx/kb) against BTCs (1.3tx/kb) and BCHs higher blocksize cap (32mb) instead of BTCs 1.5mb, the maximum that BCH can currently do is 122tx/s and it would still be at 0.1 cents/tx. And at 100tx/s, BCH would be processing more transactions than the top 10 cryptos, combined, so if it ever gets there, that'd be a major success and would put everything else to utter shame.

BCH has enabled a number of technological inventions that BTC has not (SLP, Anyhedge/Detoken, Shuffle/Fusion, memo.cash, noise.cash, etc.). It has enabled them by introducing additional opcodes that BTC rejected, improving efficiency, and alleviating blocksize constraints and other limits. And those constraints aren't going to limit BCH in the future, while they will limit BTC, forever, because you can't hardfork.

People will only buy something like BTC if it is useful in some way. Right now, it does have a ""use-case"" (albeit not a strong one) of the ability to potentially sell to someone at a higher price. It's a circular value proposition because:

BTC is good because number go up

number go up because BTC is good

If this circular line of reasoning and delusion gets broken (which will inevitably happen if the only use-case is selling to the greater fool), there is no utility in being able to transact with it (which is literally what the system is built for). Nobody will hold something that both can't make them rich, AND can't function as a medium of exchange."

But since Electron Cash doesn't have a ""spend only fused coins"" setting, you would have to specifically select fused coins to spend from for subsequent transactions. 

2. After you have a bunch of fused outputs, you probably shouldn't move them all at once in one transaction.

They can try, but they'll fail because more hashrate would just swoop in and kill their attempt at an attack. Even if it is somewhat cheap to attack BCH, there's no incentive to attack it despite being a minority chain. There is a much stronger incentive, even among those who are anti-BCH to protect the chain.

>If Bitcoin did not exist, BCH could well be the dominant network and the primary option for digital payments. As it is, AFAIK a high BTC/BCH exchange ratio combined with higher fees per block is fundamentally bad for BCH.

>At some point individual BTC mining operations could attack the BCH network whenever they feel like it, and transactions on the network can't be trusted anymore. On the hash rate graph it looks like there are already entities that occasionally have 70%+ of the BCH hash rate, but who knows whether there has been any malicious abuse so far.

They won't attack because there's a strong disincentive, and there is more than plenty enough hashrate to defend BCH when necessary, not that an attack itself would happen to begin with.

>I'm sure that your thought process is very different, so I'm curious whether there is anything I'm missing. Do you think BCH can get adopted quickly enough to get the (USD) mining rewards to a significant percentage (>30%?) of BTC?

>Processing a BCH transaction today can use CPU time that is bounded by a linear function of transaction size.

Linear function scaling would continue to be the fact, even if Group Tokens were introduced. Right now I take Andrew's claim(s) at face value, but it would be nice if others would verify it at this stage, and it would be a must to verify were it to be included in the HF.

A peer-review process. But we have to get the peers to review. Seems like Andrew could use some help motivating his peers to review, or presenting his work in a reviewable way. That's what prompted me to get the ball rolling.

>This includes database operations, since each of these can be performed in linear time and the number of these is bounded linearly by the size of the transaction.

Isn't it bounded by the **number** of outputs, though? Size can mean different things. SLP tokens add to the size of transactions, do they not? Anything in the OP_RETURN adds to the size, and it's not been a problem even though anyone's allowed to put whatever they want in to increase the size of transaction, even now.

Thing is, with OP_RETURN, miners don't have to **do** anything with that data, so it only increases the size in kilobytes of data passed around, it doesn't add cycles. More transaction outputs, linearly more time. More outputs, linearly more time. Bigger outputs because more data in each, less than linear. Why? Because miners have to doSomething() with **every** output, whether it contains a token transaction or not. That doSomething() is quite big, they have to verify the signatures, perform crypto math etc. Every output increases the number of times a miner has to call doSomething() by 1. Adding Group Tokens doesn't increase the number. It adds a little basic bookkeping math inside the doSomething() function. It piggy-backs on something miners have to do anyway, and then when all the doSomething() is finished checks the signatures + this group token running total and says whether the TX is valid or not.

**Every Group Token TX is also a BCH TX because it has to pay the fee.** This is no different than some TX which amounts to 0 BCH and has something in the OP_RETURN. It spends the entirety of inputs for fees and gets that piece of data written on the blockchain. The only difference is, it doesn't ask the miner to add a few numbers to check whether the data in the OP_RETURN makes sense. Now, SLP users/nodes do that math.

**Somebody** has to do the math for tokens to function. The argument is - it would be better for the whole ecosystem if miners did it.

Processing time would continue to be bounded by a linear function, with slightly altered slope. That's it. That'd be the cost of processing, if my understanding is correct.

>Moreover any changes should not significantly increase the size of the UTXO database.

Why it shouldn't increase it just a little, though? And how do we define what is little and what is significant? We aren't the stakeholders here. It's not our CPU and RAM that will have to process this, so we should really be asking nodes & miners that.

Would you work just a little extra to have the best simple token operations on the market? That's what we have to ask nodes & miners. There are always trade-offs. Will refusing to take a little sacrifice now prevent BCH from achieving its potential? There's this opportunity cost involved, which grows every day we're not taking action. Users will enjoy the benefit for ""free"", we're not the stakeholders. All we have to do is pay the fee if we will want to use it. Users will also enjoy the benefit of adoption by both other users and new developers who may come to use our first class tokens. And having proper tokens should help there. They will all pay for the services provided by our blockchain through BCH fees.

>There are two limiting possible UTXO implementations: a ""fast"" one that keeps database entries in RAM hashed by identifier; and a ""cheap"" one that stores database entries on random access storage.

We're far behind the hardware. Changing the slope of linear scaling won't make us get ahead of the hardware just like that, if ever. Maybe this could be argued better but I'm not equipped with arguments right now.

>Any need for locking adds huge difficulty to the designer of node software.

Agreed. Thing is, it looks like Group Tokens aren't locking, at least that's what I see from recent discussions. If when you process each output you have to doSomethingWithOutput() then this function can be executed for each output in parallel. Then, you have to tally the outputs of transaction, and again we add a little math to doSomethingWithTXes(). This one has to wait for all output processors to finish, which it has to do anyway because it has to tally BCH balance of the TX. So no extra locks there, either.

>They see that once they start criticizing Core, they will be character-assasinated just like Roger Ver was, so they shit their pants.

>They are weak.

I somewhat agree with you. Gavin Andresen at least had the courage to voice his opinion on Bitcoin Cash instead of backing out and not saying anything. What he said will always stay with me because it's one of my favourite quotes:

""Bitcoin Cash is what I started working on in 2010: a store of value AND means of exchange.""

- Gavin Andresen

I wasnt a fan of Bitcoin Cash at the time, so I didn't pay much attention. If I recall correctly, he did some development work on it, but he quit pretty quickly. Looking back, it's sad to see because I'm sure if he, along with Erik Voorhees, Brian Armstrong, Vinny Lingham, and many others' opinions who mattered at the time stood up for Bitcoin Cash and persisted just like Roger Ver has after all these years, we would've probably had an early flippening, and people would have come to realize the truth quickly. I understand short term interests, but I don't respect following them at the cost of sacrificing one's principles.

I've said this many times before, and I'll say it again: [you] worked for multiple years building on Bitcoin with a certain vision in mind, and put [your] heart and soul into it for all this time, while a group of dictators take over and pretty much take away what [you're] passionate about. Why would [you] let them take that away from you? Are [you] going to let them take that away from you so easily? (I doubt any of them are seeing this, but my point still stands)

>The herd follows such weak alphas and this is what we get: Actual ""Bitcoin"" being valuated at $400, while fake 1meg useless gregcoin climbing to $32000

Yes. It's disappointing to see. I'm sure even people who are Bitcoin skeptics now would've probably taken it more seriously if Bitcoin itself actually scaled, AND was a widely accepted medium of exchange instead of seeing it as a scam and ponzi scheme. I'm not the anti-fiat types, but a P2P network that can scale much more than traditional methods of payment as the native currency of the internet is a very cool idea. I don't think Bitcoin was particularly created with the purpose of going against fiat, but rather was just an experimental internet currency project by an enthusiast who wanted to share and improve his idea with others."

The only site that gives you the impression that BSV is in any way what Satoshi had in mind is Coingeek and their affiliates. And that site is owned by Ayre, who finances this entire fork.

Development is controlled by one company, nchain. That's not decentralized at all and already eliminates any further discussion about how close they are to Satoshis vision. Its marketing.

Since the split development of BSV went another way. The only valuable addition I see as achievement is that BSV miners managed (after a few epic fails at first) to propagate a couple of really big blocks.

And what's the achievement in ""locking in the code"" exactly? This entire industry is just one decade old. That's as counterproductive as categorically eliminating the option to hard fork like BTC devs do.

Take a look at the BSV sub, not the BitcoinSV one, to read more about serious bugs in the protocol that nchain integrated. And how no one is able to fix them because nchain controls development.

The entire point of Bitcoin is **decentralization**. You cannot take that away and claim that your coin is what Satoshi had in mind."

The limit of 50 chained unconfirmed limit for example is much more damaging. The lack of a payment protocol to enable wallets to interact with smart contracts (recurring transactions, insurance, hedging, escrow etc) is also holding back adoption significantly. The lack of automatic integrated fusion into wallets for privacy, or reusable private addresses necessary to make cashaccounts the norm - both holding back adoption. Great user interfaces for wallets is still missing as well.

I'm not saying that node developers will do all of this, but many node developers are working on multiple projects and I think their time is better spent addressing the friction preventing adoption.

If we have a big actor or usecase that requires sub-cent fees so that we know that it represents significant friction, then we should absolutely prioritize it higher."

It's not.  The attack isn't about making money on the attack itself.  The attack is about draining the bank account of your competitor until it goes bankrupt.  If you can do this forever the pool you are attacking will chronically be in the red.  Eventually they will close up shop. 

The attack is about killing your competitors.

It would be paid for and pulled off by people hostile to a particular pool (either for political reasons or business reasons).

This is why PPS mining is a very risky business.

The bonus here is that the attack itself isn't even *that* expensive.  Most of the cost of this attack is being *subsidized by the very pool you are attacking*!  You use the pool's own resources against itself."

Giving people the ability to choose is awesome, and should be how a free market works without artificially constraining their options. I have used both Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash before and I know, based on my own experience, that Bitcoin Cash works better. It's not just the high gas fees but also the unreliability of sending Ethereum transactions during peak periods. All it takes for people to realize the potential of Bitcoin Cash is for them to use it regularly. In fact, it was after using Ethereum regularly and facing those problems, that I sold them for Bitcoin Cash instead. Therefore, I think giving people choices is good and may the best coin win based on its merits."

And since the price of bitcoin went up, other people buy bitcoin, and it goes up even more.  Now you have all this valuable bitcoin, and maybe a way out of your financial predicament if you can convince people that this bitcoin is worth more than what you owe.

There's just this little problem that you don't have any bitcoin cash.  If the price of bitcoin cash starts going up, then people might start buying that instead.  And then the price of your btc might go down and you'd owe more than you have and you're screwed.

So what can you do?  You need the price of bitcoin cash to go down, so people will lose interest in that, and you can keep pumping btc.  Maybe you could do something like short selling bch. Of course you would have to pay for that, but you already owe $35 billion, what's the big deal if you tack on another billion or two?

But oh no, the price of bch keeps going up.  Now this is not only taking investment capital away from btc, but you owe all that bch back.

What can you do?  Maybe hire some people to troll on forums and hate on bitcoin cash.  Try to convince people to buy btc instead so you can get money.

Of course you have to pay all those forum trolls, but hey, it can't be any worse that what you already owe.

Try sending $10 worth of Bitcoin and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash to yourself and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just the upgraded version of Bitcoin, it also has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.

&nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&t=all

&nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://www.crypto-news-flash.com/why-does-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-fail-new-study-proves-inefficiency/

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 300 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 300 billion will give you more than 60x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage but that can only last them so long. Eventually, I believe that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the long run."

Many imagine that eliminating inflation would somehow free us from shadowy overlords that have been suppressing humanity, but that's ridiculous.

That's my whole point. If fees are $20 and you accept a $50 transaction, you're losing a good 40% of it to fees or a bit less if you merge it beforehand. Either way, you shouldn't have been accepting it in the first place. With fees at $20, realistically you need to accept transactions at a minimum of $1000 and you need to spend it in that same range.

Then why would you accept it?

Honest question, as I have noted there are plenty of other methods to accept transactions. All you are doing is backing yourself into a corner.

>LN is always the answer isn't it? 

Pretty much given even SN himself theorised payment channels. It makes the blockchain actually programmable. It's also blockchain agnostic so can be implemented onto other blockchains. Atomic swaps are also possible, BTC + LTC have already been proven. This would create an extremely cheap decentralised exchange, or receiver to accept BCH whilst the sender spending BTC for example.

>Nope. Similar thing will happen to LN on a much larger scale with high transaction fees. Channels will need to lock the fees in advance for channel closure transaction which creates a massive locking of capital for channels that are meant to bypass high fees. If you have a channel with $100 in it and fees are $20, you have 80% of your usable capacity.

Again, why would you do this? if the fees are $20, the next block fees would be closer to $100. Makes no sense. Right now you can open a channel for around $2.50. 

>That's a lot of locked capital doing nothing just in case the channel needs to get closed and will slowly kick people out of LN as BTC lives the dream and sees fees rise. 

Looking at one of my open channels right now, the reserve is about $2.50 as well, this is on a channel that has moved more sats than the total capacity of the channel - channels are bi-directional. Worth mentioning that if your channel is entirely 1 sided, you can have even less in reserve. If the other peer submits an old state, this may in fact benefit you rather than the other peer. So why would you contest?

>LN is a leveraged layer on top of the blockchain and this leverage has a limit like any financial leveraged instrument. 

Sure.

>It scales by assuming your counterparty will cooperate and not close the channel, but in practice this won't always be the case and the leverage will need to be brought down to unleveraged on-chain transactions. 

Cooperation is built entirely into the model. Given the cost of liquidity, there's very little reason to actually close a channel. As LN grows out and gets more exchanges onboard, 'consuming' a channel by sending funds to an exchange will save 2 onchain transactions. One for your peer and one for yourself. 

I also have $250 of inbound capacity to my node (you can guess how much I have used LN). To use this I can go directly to an exchange and have the benefit of 100sat fee (5 cents?). 

>You might get 10x capacity increase, which translates into 10x smaller usable payment range, but that's about it. Anything below that will be priced out.

It's probabilistic. We'd only seen a few blocks in the vicinity of 20 MB. Orphan rates of 3% can pose problems in terms of centralization incentives. If you see 0 orphans out of 10 blocks, that's enough data to show that the long-term average orphan rate will be below 3%. The 95% confidence interval for 0 events out of 10 observations is 0% to 30.85%. An orphan rate of 30.85% is definitely not acceptable.

A better way of estimating orphan rate when working with minimal datasets to do this is to just measure the block propagation and validation times and use the formula `p(t) = 1 - e^(-t/600)` to calculate what the orphan rate *should* be, assuming that block intervals follow the exponential distribution (which they generally do except when hashrate switching is significant. Block propagation was taking around 20 seconds for the largest blocks in the stress test (much more for slow nodes, but around 20 sec for the high-performance nodes that we'd expect miners and pools to be using), which implies an expected orphan rate on the order of 3.2%. That would give a pool with 30% of the hashrate a 1% profitability advantage over smaller pools from mere hashrate effects and accidental selfish mining effects, which I consider to be right on the border between acceptable and unacceptable."

Youtube was always valuable for google even before it started to break even in isolation because of how well it fit with google, it is integrated into google and google into it, it is hard to estimate the total impact the ownership of the site has had for google. Google plus failed so the social media section of google is basically the youtube comment section, sad as it is.  


The downside is that since google has a virtual monopoly on targeted advertisement online other video sites simply can't even stay alive and without googles ad-efficiency/price and google-platform integration.

I appreciate you stating the obvious.

> As the price of BCH rises, the fee will also rise in USD

This is correct, but let me rephrase that a bit for you so you can properly understand what you have just said.

""As the fiat value of BCH rises, the fee will also rise in that specific fiat denomination.""

> If the merchant requires me to wait, then that defetas the purpose of ""insant""

I believe on of the issues you need to come to grips with is that you (and by you I mean your end of the transaction) is not always the most important actor in the transaction. You alone do not get to dictate to the other end, just as the other end does not get to dictate to you. You both should be agreeing to the what standard will be used. Usually this is done by acceptance of the payment method you are using. A merchant does not need to require anyone to wait, but they may chose to do so based upon their perceived level of risk. 

> there is no ""instant"", there's only near-instant, instant doesn't exist as there is always a time period between two things. the closer to instant you are, the better you are 

Neat, a change in the goal posts; I was wondering when you were going to get to it. First you feel the need to make a distinction between your 0.3 second Nano transaction vs the 1-3 second BCH transaction; conveniently ignoring my many of my points by not even addressing them. 

> yes, that population does not know Nano exists now, but it's gaining popularity, FAST, it's the one of the fastest growing finance subreddits,

So... you admit that there is a portion of the population that does not know that Nano exists, but you seem to still believe that the initial distribution of Nano was fair. I'm sorry but reasonable people would gather both those pieces of information and conclude that ""Nano was fairly distributed"" is false.

> im not saying BCH is bad, i would just be worried if I was all-in on BCH without diversifying into newer, faster, better tech

Yes you are, you're merely doing so in a round about way. Own up to what you are trying to convey, you'll be respected by some more for being honest. Not from me, but surely from some, most notably others that reaped the completely unfair initial distribution of Nano.

**Edit:** I am coming back through these replies I recently composed to let you know that further discussion will likley prove pointless, as I truly do not believe you are open to information provided to you throughout the lengthy and well thought out replies you have received in the past 24 hours.

The donations on the site you're sharing are not for OB1 specifically, which was venture funded, and which doesn't have anything about donations on their site. [https://ob1.io](https://ob1.io/)

The irony of the IFP rhetoric (and that's mostly all it is) positioning the choice as ""donor funded or miner funded"" is that miners aren't really funding it at all in a meaningful sense. They are taking a trivial profit cut and lowering the difficulty on the chain to pay for the IFP, ie, they don't pay a real financial opportunity cost (the security cost is trivial and we've already seen that the hash can drop really low and still not be attacked) and thus have no incentive to keep ABC in check, nor a proper way to ""price"" the work because they're not bearing the cost themselves.

It's got a lot of the same incentives and problems with quasi-government agencies. Sure, no force is involved, but another problem in the incentive model of government orgs is that they don't pay real opportunity costs. So too with the IFP.

The delusion that BCH is used for anything else but specifically speculation is strong on this one... Go look at [statistics of payment processors like Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/stats/), BCH represents less than 5% of the payments, meanwhile Bitcoin is more than 75%. And we're also talking about such small numbers anyways for all coins, 100k transactions a month for all assets, which means BCH does a measly 5k transactions a month... that's not even 200 transactions a day...

You beloved altcoin is more Wall Stree's play thing than Bitcoin is, look at it's price activity, it has all the marking of getting pumped and dumped on a regular basis... and it's also the miners' plaything, which abuse the DAA (even after the many ""fixes"" you've tried).

There's also very little work done in terms of cryptography in BCH's development, pretty much every single mechanism used is copied from Bitcoin's dev implementations (see Libsec256k1 and Schnorr sigs)... but keep pretending to be cypherpunks when you literally just copy/paste the work of actual cypherpunks if you think it helps your ""marketing"", you're not fooling any actual cypherpunk."

76223,ggkt9iw,t3_khfh5w,1608550407.0,khfh5w,btc,6,False,False,"You are still early for Bitcoin Cash which is an upgraded version of BTC, paving the way for reliable high capacity low fee transactions. There is no way that a logical person/business prefers to pay higher fees for a slow unreliable service when there is a cheaper better faster alternative Bitcoin Cash. Try sending $10 worth of Bitcoin and $10 worth of Bitcoin Cash to yourself and see for yourself the difference. But Bitcoin Cash is more than just fast cheap and reliable, it also has many unique advantages over the old Bitcoin. Here are the improvements from Bitcoin Cash.

&nbsp;

**Better Security** – BTC has a vulnerability called RBF which increases the risk of double spending. Bitcoin Cash developers aim to make 0-confirmation transactions safe again so that anyone accepting Bitcoin Cash is much safer accepting payments without having to wait for multiple confirmations. This RBF security vulnerability exists only in BTC and not Bitcoin Cash. That's why Bitcoin Cash is more secure as a payment method.

Here is an example of hackers stolen $150000 worth of BTC using the RBF security vulnerability. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/03/14/double-spenders-scam-150000-bitcoin/

It is super easy to double spend on Bitcoin using the RBF vulnerability. Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/video-shows-how-easy-it-is-to-double-spend-btc-using-rbf/

&nbsp;

**Improved Scalability** – BTC is limited to 1MB block size and even with Segwit activated, the capacity increase is only around 1.7x whereas the upgraded Bitcoin Cash blocks capacity is currently at 32x with no limitations. This means Bitcoin Cash can handle PayPal transactions volume today and be global money after a few more upgrades.

&nbsp;

**Supply Scarcity** – During the fork from Bitcoin, some Bitcoin Cash supply were removed from active circulation due to users unable to claim their Bitcoin Cash from unsupported exchanges and wallets among other reasons. This means each Bitcoin Cash is actually more scarce than BTC.

&nbsp;

**Improved Confirmation Times** – Due to the limited block size of BTC, some users were made to wait days for their transactions to be confirmed. Contrast this to Bitcoin Cash where transactions may be accepted immediately with less risk and you can see why it makes sense to use Bitcoin Cash. In other words, if you are a shop owner and you just sold a cup of coffee and some sandwiches, and you accept the old BTC, you may have to wait hours for the transaction to be confirmed because the customer may use RBF to void the original payment. With Bitcoin Cash, your risk is minimized.

&nbsp;

**Higher Merchants Adoption** - Bitcoin Cash is global money with more than 2,651,820 merchants accepting it. You can pay for your hotels, air tickets, food/drinks, groceries, nightlife, and more with Bitcoin Cash today. Source: https://1bch.com/?action=showBitcoinCashBenefitsFrame

While Bitcoin Cash adoption is growing very quickly every single day, Bitcoin is having declining adoption and if this trend continues then Bitcoin is on a dead end. Source: https://np.reddit.com/r/NotAcceptingBitcoin/top/?sort=top&t=all

&nbsp;

**Low Fees** – One of the advantages of using cryptocurrencies over traditional payment methods is the low fees. Due to the limited block size of BTC, fees have exceeded over $70/transaction during peak period. On the other hand, I have never paid more than 1 penny/transaction during my entire time in using Bitcoin Cash. This makes using Bitcoin Cash ideal for merchants, businesses, companies and everyday usage. The industries that may be disrupted such as Remittances, Payment Gateways, etc are worth trillions of dollars and Bitcoin Cash is well positioned for use cases in these industries.

&nbsp;

**Lightning Network Problems And Vulnerabilities And Loss Funds** - Some people may claim Lightning Network will solve Bitcoin problems but it has failed to gain traction due to many problems and vulnerabilities, such as loss of funds, unreliable transactions (constantly failing), and many other vulnerabilities.

Source: https://news.bitcoin.com/researchers-scathing-lightning-network-analysis-finds-flaws/

&nbsp;

**Tokens** - Bitcoin Cash has tokens to start taking some marketshare from Ethereum. Today, anyone can issue their own loyalty tokens or digital money on Bitcoin Cash from as low as 1 cent to mint it. It's incredibly easy and anyone can do it at https://mint.bitcoin.com/

&nbsp;

**Better Privacy** - Bitcoin Cash has better privacy than BTC thanks to CashShuffle/CashFusion. You can enable it through the setting in the Electron Cash wallet and it's completely optional. If you don't want others to know how you spent your money, it is better to use Bitcoin Cash over BTC.

&nbsp;

**Better Risk/Reward** - If BTC gains another 300 billion marketcap, it only 2x in price. But that same 300 billion will give you more than 60x your Bitcoin Cash investments. It is such a smarter option given the risk/rewards probabilities.

&nbsp;

At the moment, the old BTC has first mover advantage but that can only last them so long. Eventually, I believe that Bitcoin Cash will overtake BTC's marketcap in the long run."

You are absolutely right about not selling ourselves short, but equally we should not oversell the capabilities of BCH and succumb to wishful thinking, that will only hurt BCH in the long run.

If anyone has to choose between few lines of solidity (soon EWASM) on ETH or literally a computer science project to implement something like Flipstarter on BCH, while achieving every design goal on ETH and hacked together gooblygoop with annoying limitations on BCH, well, can you guess where all the developers will gravitate towards?

>No miners want bcha, but it's still being mined and has value

Now you're getting confused, that's a tautology. If no miners wanted BCHA, there would be no miners mining it. And the microscopic ""value"" of BCHA is highly tenuous, only a tiny fraction of BCHA holders can even split their coins, deposit them to a handful of dodgy exchanges, and sell them. Not to mention the BCHA-A and BCHA-B forks, what a joke that is.  

Are you forgetting that BCHA was the reference implementation only 3 weeks ago? The BCH project was hard forked in a manner almost exactly how I describe a larger block BTC hard fork could theoretically be executed! 

>mining support follows market support. 

That's speculation, and I doubt it's true. There *were no markets* when mining started! And clearly miners can create market support artificially. BTC market support is particularly opaque and subject to all kinds of factors like Tether printing, massive fractional reserves, Twitter pumping, and idiotic Core propaganda. We can be fairly certain that much of that market support would evaporate in the event of a BTC hard fork. And much of it would simply stick with the chain with the vast majority of hash. Sure there would be Coretards with Raspberry Pies refusing to upgrade their nodes, but eventually they would see the futility of their actions. 

>As  long as someone is willing to support the price of BCHA or small block  BTC, then it will be mined. The proof is staring you in the face.

You're saying that a reference implementation turning into a tiny minority shitcoin fork is evidence that the reference implementation can't be hard forked? Bitcoin Gold and 20+ BTC shitforks are also still mined, do you think they steal value from BTC? Again, it doesn't matter if two forks of a coin are mined if there is a clear winner in one arena: mining hashpower dominance. Nobody is going to cling to a BTC that has 5% of total SHA256 hashpower when another fork has 95%. 

I do acknowledge the need for some buyers of a coin, so I can slightly revise my concept of miners forking BTC. The miners would benefit from a lot of buyers of the new majority fork. But if someone can spend the hundreds of millions to buy all of the miners, spending millions buying up the new fork coins would be child's play. And imagine the dumps of the small block BTC in the event of chain death!

The real reason miners don't fork to larger block BTC are likely: risk of crashing BTC value and secret agreements with Blockstream/Core and Bitfinex."

> they definitely don't have much economic advantage in co-opting BCH. While I don't believe the ""ABC-heist"" theory, there is no denying that a relative stream of guaranteed income is a great thing. BCHN has made clear they do not plan on implementing any sort of IFP like mechanism (at least now), so they have no advantage in taking over the reigns of BCH unless they plan on doing something productive with it. If they don't, not only will they not make money, if they aren't good then BCH just loses value and then everyone, including them, loses. You may think their interest will fizzle out and be generally harmful for BCH, but objectively speaking they have more to lose by holding BCH and not moving the project forward.

They are after control and power over BCH. Maybe to block progress if they work for the troll army masters or just because they do not want to do what Amaury tells them to do. The money behind this takeover is unlikely to be doing it to make money for themselves or BCH users. Maybe BTC miners? I am not sure.

> A split could be a good thing. A collaborative effort to continue the project despite disagreements is a better thing.""

I agree in theory. Check this out: https://read.cash/@ProfLiu/the-suggestion-for-the-rational-and-harmonious-fork-of-bch-cd488c7c  My comment there: 

>> ""Very well said!

>> In theory, I think you nailed the situation and a good solution. Sadly, I think this ""war"" has been manufactured by anti-BCH forces with powerful social engineering efforts to personalize a variety of valid and dishonest grievances into a power struggle between personalities instead of a battle between technologies. I think the kind of compromise needed to bring anti-ABC developers and other critical players back together might require ""Amaury's head on a platter"". Personally, I would be OK with that if there was a ready replacement that could keep BCH moving forward with less negativity. I see no equally talented and trustworthy new leadership offering to do the work. Maybe the 8% funding-distribution-governance system could take all of Amaurys power over the fund away? That could help with the so far unjustified ""power grab"" claims, but I think the personal animosities may continue to overshadow reasonable discussions.

>> Edit: Also, many believe the whole community is behind BCHN. The anti-BCH army of accounts has been claiming this for months (since before it might have been true) and now many real BCH fans believe it. It does seem true on social media where the social engineering is very strong. I am not sure it is actually true, but I believe fooling social media can be enough to fool the real community into thinking they are the minority view.""



> If Bitcoin splits at every people-problem roadblock, then ...

Ya, it is a problem and that is why the anti-Bitcoin social engineering firms keep trying to break us up. I think there will be only one team that solves scaling and makes BCH into a real Bitcoin. How to get there is currently disputed, but the BCHN way is to get there by NOT funding development. I am not sure they have good intentions behind their teams good statements. We do all want to believe in their perfect (very professionally written) claims, of course."

No, I just don't argue about things that are hypothetical. It's a fact that Amaury is trying to direct 8% of coinbase rewards to an address he controls, under the guise that the community should simply trust him to use it for funding ABC development. Nothing hypothetical there. If you trust him, that's your business. But myself and others believe it shouldn't matter whether he is trustworthy or not, simply by having this power to direct the coinbase rewards is the end of Nakamoto Consensus on BCH. Luckily, we have devs who are moving forward and retaining the trustless aspects of BCH and ABC will be left behind in the dust.

I hope you'll join us."

I dunno, bro. Bragging about how little your coin is used is a pretty weak argument, if you ask me. 

Let's look at some stats. First, [Transaction volume dating back to August 1st, 2017](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/transactions-btc-bch.html#3y)

Notice the difference? Notice the areas under each curve? Notice how Bitcoin is under constant demand and BCash is uh... not?

Next, let's look at the [ratio](https://www.tradingview.com/x/tGWQRu5t/). Ouch! No need to even comment further on that train wreck. 

Finally, let's look at the [difficulty](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/difficulty-btc-bch.html#3y). Good Lord! You'd need a jeweler's eye to see BCash on that chart.

You can kick and scream all you want to complain about Bitcoin but at the end of the day... Bitcoin is still king and BCash is a failing shitcoin, with constantly diminishing value. 

Sucks to be a BCasher, it seems. Can you do an AMA on what it's like to be a bagholder?"

If I had it I would be totally willing to help fund it but I think people like Roger, Marc or a dev team like bitcoin cash node should use some of their funds.

I build gives the opportunity to try to build many new things on the blockchain all at once and if an attempt is amazing but can't finish in the time it can still be followed up after the event is over if the product could be useful.

The only feature traditional digital money systems can't provide is irreversibly. It's by design not desired. So yes, that is the point. The rest can improved over time, the minute you neglect or compromise this to improve the others quicker than you technologically can (you fail you own controlled ""stresstests"" with your new capacity for example, a good sign that you overshot), you are an inferior form of money once again, and you're a fragile one actually that can be disposed of by governments or large entities. Because you don't get this immutability without decentralization, and chances are, like BCH, you will compromise on decentralization to provide those low fees at all time.

> Hardware wallets are for dumb people. You have to TRUST the company, trust the hardware, trust the software, trust.. trust.. trust. BLINDLY TRUST.  And don't come here and say ""iTs oPeN SouRcEd BrO"" - because you have to be a fucking engineer to make sure the hardware HAS THE SAME CODE YOU SEE ON GITHUB.

Well.. sort of. Open source in particular doesn't require you personally to be able to verify it. The fact that it *can* be verified means that popular software gets verified by *somebody*, and all it takes is one person to sound an alarm. So it's not necessarily that you personally need to be able to verify it, but by being open source, it allows you to be able to choose who you trust to do the verification. That can be you, but it can also be whatever expert you cede the responsibility to. And again, for large projects, especially ones that have multiple implementations and other work being done by many contributors, the chances are good that the project has been reviewed fairly thoroughly... and all without any kind of formal audit -- that's just the benefit of being open source.

However, none of this is relevant because IIRC Ledger firmware is not open source. That is problematic, because among other worries, you can't be confident in the RNG for creating a seed, which is why I recommend to people who use hardware wallets to generate the seed in a more secure fashion and use the import/restore feature. (Of course, you have to make sure they generate it in an actually secure fashion, since without guidance many of them might attempt to simply make a seed on their own and create a bad and decidedly non-random seed. See posts and videos about brain wallets being hacked for some examples of this.)

Barring the RNG, the only thing you have to worry about is what data enters and leaves the device. Since it's a closed system, you don't really care about whether the software running it is open or closed, only the data that leaves it. (There are some people who might care -- those engineers that you point out may actually be able to check the components and extract data from the physical hardware. But for the vast majority of people, the security lies in the device being isolated from their networked computer and their private keys thus being safe in the event their computer is compromised.) And if you're concerned about data entering and leaving, you need to find a way to (or hire somebody you trust) to MITM the usb connection and record the data entering and leaving.

> Also, ofc you have to trust each and every firmware update.

See above.

> When dealing with cryptocurrencies you should NEVER have to TRUST a third party.

Again.. sort of. As with open source hardware and software, they allow you to choose where to place your trust. Unless you design and fabricate your own PCB board and your own CPU and your own other components, and only run open source OS and software that you compiled yourself on such hardware, and read ever line of code before compiling it, and didn't make any mistakes.... unless you do all that, at some point, you're trusting somebody else for part of the setup.

Cryptocurrency, and open source software and hardware, allow you to choose how to delegate your trust. You *can* do it all yourself, but you can also choose who to trust. *That's* what makes open source valuable. With regards to crypto, many people choose to leave their money on exchanges, deciding that the risk of loss from the exchange is worth it to them, because they aren't competent to hold onto the crypto themselves, or the risk of loss is worth it because they don't want to spent the time/effort to protect themselves. That's a personal risk decision for them. It's all about weighing risk and reward and deciding what is acceptable for you.

> Best way is to OFFLINE sign your transaction and then after confirming it YOURSELF you broadcast it to the network. That's the only fully secure way to use crypto if you have a brain.

Your computer could still be compromised at the hardware level. Your compromised live OS might write something to the hard drive that your main OS can see. Or your offline computer might have a hardware keylogger that a malicious actor has physically placed.

The threats are different, and less likely, but nothing is fool-proof.

That's in fact why people use hardware wallets. It keeps the private keys off the main computer and allows for basically the same security as your offline signing. But in an easier-to-use format. The hardware may be compromised or the device may leak information.... but again, these threats are more difficult to exploit and less likely to happen, and so your overall security is still much higher using such a device than keeping your keys on an online computer.

> Electron does an amazing job with watch-only wallets and offline sign. Just use it.

And did you read the Electrum code and make sure it's not giving you malformed malicious tx hex when you save your unsigned transaction?

> DONT TRUST.

As I've continually said, it's all about making good risk/reward decisions and choosing where and how to place your trust. If you are especially paranoid, you may want to do more yourself. If not, you may choose to delegate more. It just depends on your level of confidence in your own skills to check things versus the people you choose to trust. Maybe you keep 10% of your money on your computer to spend and use, 30% in a hardware wallet, and 60% in a secure underground vault with a seed generated from decaying atoms.

No, Bitcoin Cash started pumping only when SegWit 2X was called off, which was on November 8th, 2017. During that time, lots of people on both Bithumb and Coinbase were selling off their BTC for BCH because SegWit 2X's cancellation was a lot of peoples' (big and small-blockers alike) last hope for Bitcoin scaling on-chain destroyed, which wanted them to get out of BTC and into BCH. This caused the price of BTC to dump, while BCH skyrocketed.

Bithumb had supposedly faced a lot of traffic, which caused the exchange to crash, and the price of BCH to plummet. They had faced a lot more traffic before, but interestingly enough they didn't crash during those other times. I think ultimately, the rally being cut short was the result of a series of DDOS attacks on the exchange."

However, the major pools are using a special fast protocol for sharing new blocks, so a block by an outside pool (which I assume was the case) would probably not even have that advantage.

Most likely it was just laziness, as others have written.  That pool/miner did not bother to do all the hard work required to assemble real blocks -- download and validate the full blockchain, receive, validate, and store all the new transactions from users, select the most profitable among them, etc.  To mine an empty block, he only needed to download (and trust) the hash of the previous block.

The only thing that can reduce the electricity expenditure is if a few companies invent new miners and keep the technology secret and for themselves and dominate the hash power.

About the environmental impact, it’s outrageous. One transaction requires currently 900kWh of electricity spent. That’s between 200-500kg of CO2, for one transaction.

Trading one crypto for another crypto is a taxable event in the US and most other places with similar tax rules. Spending crypto is a taxable event, even if it is for goods and services. Giving away crypto as a tip or gift is also likely taxable but it can be tax exempt in certain situations like giving to a approved charity or by allowing the crypto giver to transfer the cost basis to the recipient.  


Some places also have wealth taxes where the price of the crypto at the end of the year is used to calculate the taxes. Cashing out does not mean literally exchanging for cash, any trade between any pair counts, there is no like-kind exchange in crypto.

I would even go as far as say that you being in control of your computer instead of a proprietor is a necessity to be able to achieve full economic freedom.

(as an example, how do you know your private keys/seeds aren't generated predictably because of low-level proprietary software that is in (almost) every modern computer?)

I also think the BCH community should focus more on freedom and the freedom of the users. I think licensing more software (especially nodes) under the GPL would go a long way to protect against attacks from bad actors, like what happened with BSV. They took BCHs code and turned it into proprietary software that takes away the users freedom. They convinced a part of the bch community to join them and without most of them realising it a big part of their freedom has been taken away.

This is a threat that will continue. Governments will look at existing free software cryptocurrency projects, take their code and turn it into something proprietary. Do you really want to write code that ends up into a government made proprietary cryptocurrency project for something like a digital euro or digital usd that is made to take away many users freedoms and privacy and directly threaten freedom respecting cryptocurrencies, code that is unforkable or not even public at all? Because i don't. I think writing software that requires the redistributor of that code (modified or not) to give the same freedoms to their users that they got themselves with the software is a necesity to give USERS the freedom they need.

So by now the most demanded quality of crypto coming from most of places that represent most of the demand is as a store of value.

And for that use you don't care if you pay $2 for storing $10,000 in savings, in fact much lower than any bank. And that would be if you need a confirmation in the next block which is not needed for that use either. I've never paid more than 15 cents if you can just wait a few hours. Even less if you don't mind waiting a couple of days.

We'll see if there is a market for using it as a currency. But I think if you don't secure the hard money quality first, we would just be creating another Paypal. The difference in crypto is that you should be able to transact without censorship but also store without the theft of inflation.

Plain clothes law enforcement asking someone to deliver some package they think is just a regular package that really contains illegal material is entrapment.  


Giving a great deal on a hit job or pressuring someone to take out a hit is not entrapment. The person that did order the hit was by definition willing to commit a hit."

I looked at the difficulty of 2 consecutive blocks and saw the difficulty increase between them just as I expected.

If over the entire period of 32 blocks, the average time between blocks is greater than 10 minutes, then the difficulty would indeed decrease over the entire period. But mining more blocks in the same period can't decrease the difficulty faster than fewer, or just one block."
