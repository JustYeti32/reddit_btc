Rather than trying to time the market , let time work for you.

In a bull market it might be wise to make DCA investments with market order buys + place in limit order buys to auto pickup the dips if you don't have the capital up front , otherwise lump sum buying will typically outperform DCA.

I tried the QR code method but I don't think I scanned the right one. As for doing it manually, it asks to copy it from the clipboard instead of a file which is annoying.

Should I try a different wallet for Android?"

The whole reason Blocks in Blockchain's exist is Proof of work. Blocks are a consequence of Proof of work and one of the least interesting things about Bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is the only Cryptocurrency proven itself to be secure and decentralized

99% of altcoins/ICOs are scams and its difficult to evaluate them unless you know the history of these projects and are a programmer yourself so can evaluate their claims

Altcoins will come and go as we have always seen but bitcoin having a first mover advantage means that it is has the most network effect and best chance of surviving longterm 

One of the primary reasons Bitcoin was created was to have a sound monetary policy and digital scarcity , and being a multicoiner undermines all of this

Using wallets and software that supports multiple coins is confusing  and can lead to mistakes where you can lose money and makes the software far more insecure with a wider attack surface and potential for bugs and exploits 

When looking at the long term graphs , most altcoins pump and dump and lose value relative to Bitcoin. 

Getting involved with altcoins forces you to spend a ton of extra time learning complex and obscure projects 

Scammers prefer to target people that use altcoins as we saw with the ICO craze because Bitcoiners tend to have more experience and be more skeptical to evaluate their claims

Being involved in altcoins usually means you don't have long term time preferences and simply want to speculate short term which many people will consider a character flaw because you are more of a gambler 

Bitcoin has an uphill battle as is so any distractions weakens the possibility of it becoming a global p2p currency (Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency that can achieve this with its network effect, technology, and roadmap)

100,000 nodes: this is a rough estimate. When you consider listening nodes as part of the equation, then the number is likely much higher.

What percentage: Assuming this would constitute a hard fork, then you would need the majority of the network to abide by the new consensus rules. This includes mining hash power, node operators, etc.

How will they agree: there's a very strong status-quo bias in abiding by consensus rules, so there will have to be a very strong reason to shift over to more than 100,000,000 sats/bitcoin. Otherwise, there might be a chain split, like what happened in 2017 with BTC vs. BCH.

Affect on price: nobody knows, but likely down, as most markets price bitcoins, not satoshis.

Keep in mind that the 100,000,000 sats/bitcoin was likely well-thought-out design decision. Satoshi must've thought about the upper limit and ratio of sats:bitcoin. Bitzuma explains the rationale in this excellent [blog post](https://bitzuma.com/posts/the-21-million-bitcoin-question/).

* the eventual money stock, expressed in satoshis, fits cleanly within the IEEE floating point representation system;
* the eventual money stock, expressed in satoshis, roughly equals global M1 money stock in 2009, expressed in cents;
* the satoshi to bitcoin ratio of 100,000,000:1 ensured that dollar parity would be achieved around the time that Bitcoin’s network valuation matched M1 of the world’s smallest countries;
* the halving schedule ensures that the block subsidy will continue to be paid until Bitcoin has reached a critical mass of adoption.

Also, you may want to explore the Lightning Network, which is designed for micropayments. It is already possible to send a milli satoshi (a thousandth of a satoshi) within the Lightning Network, though when you settle your LN transactions on-chain, it will be rounded to the nearest satoshi.

Bitcoin is arguably the most ""simple"" coin in terms of tech: newer coins all have much fancier protocols. Ironically, this ""simplicity"" is one of the reasons of Bitcoin's strength: the more simple is the code, the more robust is the whole system. You can see here [https://d.center/explore/bitcoin-mechanism](https://d.center/explore/bitcoin-mechanism) Bitcoin mechanism isn't actually all that complicated (although undoubtedly genius). Also, its code has been in open source for more than 10 years, so the best world hackers have had ample opportunities to examine it (and sometimes bugs were found and corrected).

So now Bitcoin is definitely in the vertuous circle of bigger network -> more secure network, which largely explains its dominance. Every ten minutes Bitcoin becomes ever stronger.

Newer cryptocurrencies with a fancier tech not only could be more vulnerable to bugs and hacks, they also need time to start vertuous circles of their own."

Letting someone else hold your bitcoins is probably ok for small amounts, but the risks begin to matter when you own an amount whose value is significant to you.

The keys are stored in the wallet app on the phone. Go to bitcoin.org to select a wallet.

Not really. Total anonymity is difficult.

Here are some examples -

1) Individuals who don't want to coinjoin(mix) their coins and want better privacy will sometimes mine Bitcoin even if they simply break even 

2) Hobbiyists who find mining fun 

3) Those with free or inexpensive electricity from sunk costs and/or those who recycle the waste heat can be profitable as well 

4) Bitcoin supporters who wish to mine to help secure the network 

Are a few examples. Additionally, the trend is more favorable to smaller miners due to ""Moore's cliff"" - read about it here-

Just started this month and have had good experiences with Coinbase and Coinbase Pro. Both are very easy to use. I would suggest to start with Coinbase as it's a bit simpler to purchase and transfer to a wallet. The fee's are less with Coinbase Pro but you have to manually factor in the transfer fee which can be a bit confusing at first.

If you're looking for a wallet, I'm currently using the ZenGo app which is a key-less wallet. I asked this sub a few weeks back about it but I don't think anyone that saw had heard of it. I gave it ago and have been happy. Eventually you'll probably want to move to a physical wallet but for now you don't have to worry too much about keeping them in an online one.

Make sure you've confirmed that the bank account you want to buy with accepts cryptocurrency transactions. I had to create a whole new account with a different bank as my main one doesn't accept them.

Lastly, look into investing with the Dollar Cost Average (DCA) strategy. It's basically spending small amounts over the course of weeks or months instead of a large amount in bulk.

I think the choice is clear here: less is more.

I personally bought some etching tools, because those stamping kits can be expensive, BUT get ready spending a bit of time etching it if you have weak arms like I do! It usually takes me about half an hour for one plate. The joys of being a super tiny woman, I tell ya, lol.

And this is more for anyone who might be reading this, not really directed at you specifically: I also follow ColdTi's suggestion of using the BIP39 (SLIP39 in my case, since I use a Shamir backup) numbers to encode the seedphrase words, so would-be thieves would have to put in a tiiiny bit more effort to try to get my seedphrase... but then they'd have to get the rest of the shares, too. ;) And don't etch your passphrase (AKA your 25th word) alongside your seedphrase, FFS!

**Statistically Lump Sum investing will outperform DCA investing.**

DCA is usually the best advice for those that don't have the capital upfront.

For investing in any assets = realty, stocks, bitcoin, or gold the best advice is to make a solid plan after doing your research up front, diversify with uncoorelated asset classes that are properly hedged and invest all up front. This is especially true with Bitcoin because no one can predict the price and most appreciation happens on a few days each year that are unexpected so the quicker you own BTC , the quicker you get exposure to this appreciation.

This being said you should not be investing at all in Bitcoin unless you have paid off all your high interest debt and have at least 3-6 months of fiat in an emergency fund to cover living expenses.

Lump sum investing outperformed DCA investing 68% of the time according to a Vanguard study -

https://www.fool.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-what-investors-need-to-know.aspx

2 reasons -

1) stocks (I suggest an index fund like SPDR ) and BTC have an inherent upwards bias so the sooner you invest the quicker you can accumulate appreciation

2) Inflation drag - fiat uninvested will be slowly losing value due to inflation"

Just watch out for the odd scammer that will DM you attempting to get your 24 words. The real help always happens publicly where other users can verify the information. 

If you plan to keep it locked away for a while then a hardware wallet is definitely the way to go. I’m not sure how much understanding you have of blockchain technology but a hardware wallet doesn’t actually store your coins. It stores your seed/private keys (24 words) offline. 

I personally use a Ledger and I’m very happy with it. There’s just a lot of concern regarding recent leaked information, but it was only of their customer database and didn’t effect security/funds. However it meant scammers had peoples email addresses, phone numbers and physical addresses which led to a lot of people losing money to phishing scams."

You have two choices.  Ether enter into a coop with many other parties (15 of 15) then have a multisig wallet shared among you.  Now the guy with the wrench needs to waive the wrench at 15 people instead of just you.  Downside is now you are banking by committee.  Any withdraw will need to be agreed upon by all the key holder in your mini-bitcoin-trust.

Your other option is called CLTV.  It's a way to store bitcoin in a blockchain timelock.  You could place one bitcoin that unlocks every decade.  1BTC in 2020, 1BTC in 2030, 1BTC in 2040.  They can waive the wrench all they want, no one can break the timelock.  All they can do is wait."

Couldn’t really wrap my head around what it was. I was 21 at the time and had no real knowledge of personal finance or economics and I only used a computer for YouTube videos and Facebook, so I really showed no interest. Fast forward 6 years to January 2018 and I’m like “oh, this bitcoin thing looks quite interesting actually, down the rabbit hole i go” I have had a few moments where I really get myself down about not listening or taking more interest back in 2012 but then i realize I could never change who I was or the decisions that I made but only to make better decisions moving forward with the lessons I’ve learnt. 21 year old me only cared about drinking, chasing girls and getting payed, financial freedom was the last thing on my mind & even if I had decided to invest some money it may of only been $20 and I probably would of lost the keys.

So i put 2k into it gradually over 4/5 months starting Jan 2018 & watched it go down, I left it alone for a while & then started again in March this year. Safe to say I’ve been dropping nearly all of my available salary into bitcoin since September & still doing the same now, my conviction has never been stronger. Good luck with staying positive.

Ethereum is a premined scam.


1)	Vitalik and many others in the Ethereum space are known scammers. Vitalik is not an idiot thus he should have known better than pitch something as ridiculous as quantum mining to potential investors. This is a snake oil salesman pitching technical nonsense  to the credulous.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkUpZkeqhF4

https://medium.com/bitcoinerrorlog/vitaliks-quantum-quest-9e6af6570f23

2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security

3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness""

4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?

5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were than immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 

6)	For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

7)	Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon. This second attempt won’t do any better than the first IMHO.

8) the fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your eth unlike bitcoin being staked will expose you to taxes. Coinbase for example files 1099MISC for any staking over 600 usd a year to the IRS

If tesla used Coinbase then they probably strike a purchase every 10 mins over a few weeks so it doesn’t move the market. Coinbase would just build the algorithm for them to buy from the market. Coinbase doesn’t sell it directly to tesla but will be the broker (guessing that Coinbase worked with tesla to do this)

This was my logic on deciding between Trezor and Ledger. Each has an expensive wallet and a cheap wallet. I am a cheap bastard, so you can guess where I was leaning.

**Trezor Model T vs. Trezor Model One** \- Model One wins. The T is more than 3X the price of the One. For that you get a larger device and a bunch of altcoins most will tell you to stay away from. 

**Nano S vs. Nano X** \- Nano S wins. The X is a little less than 2X an S. For that you get a larger device, bluetooth and a bunch of altcoins most will tell you to stay away from.

This brought my choice to either the One or the S. Which did I buy? I bought both! The price of a One and an S combined is less than the price of a standalone T or X. Now I get to play with each.

* Trezor wins for interface
* Ledger wins for form factor (smaller)

Which do I use the most? The Trezor. While not as small as the S, it is small enough and I prefer the interface of the Trezor. The only reason I would even remotely consider getting a T or an X is USB-C. However, for a \~100 EUR price delta... I will stick with the microUSB to USB-C dongle that shipped with my phone."

Well I think I'm nearly at the end of my ""create-a-new-bitcoin-address"" adventure! Alright, I know, I'm taking advantage of your knowledge! But to be fair, thanks to all here I've learnt so much and that's encouraged me to investigate even more, I'm finding out a lot of stuff on my own now! :-D   I've discovered this wonderful thing called a ""master PUBLIC key"", and it seems it's superconvenient because it lets me create an address with Ian Coleman tool and then I can create a ""watch only"" wallet (in Electrum for example) and I don't have to give Electrum my PRIVATE key - my private key can stay offline.

My doubt though is regarding which field in the Coleman tool corresponds to the ""master public key"". He doesn't use this term anywhere on his page, however, he does use ""BIP32 Extended Public Key"" and ""Account Extended Public Key"". Which one of these do you think corresponds to ""Master Public Key""?

Secondly, am I right in saying that it's a bad idea to show my master public key to anyone because if they have it they could see the balances in all my accounts that I have both now and in the future? Or is the scenario even worse - can they obtain a PRIVATE key from this master PUBLIC key?"

There's a complicated math process involved to sign such a transaction with your private key.  That is not feasible to do by hand, so it must be done by a computer. The ledger is this computer. It uses your private keys, that only it knows, to sign your transactions.

You could also use your normal PC or phone for this, but then the PC/phone would have to have access to the keys. Which would mean that the keys were exposed on an internet-connected computer - a ""hot wallet"". The ledger is never connected to the internet."

Something I didn't cover was the importance of protecting your seed word list. You must store your 24 (or 25) words in such a way that it cannot be physically destroyed nor can it be intercepted by any unauthorized people. That's where cryptosteel or coldti comes in. 

You will store the first four letters of your words by sliding indestructible letters into slots or pounding them into a steel plate. If your house burns down, you want to be able to locate your storage and enter the words in a new wallet.

By having your words, you'll be able to reconstruct all of your wallets and all of your coins as if nothing happened at all. Don't just write them down on paper and stick 'em in a desk drawer. Your words mean everything to you in your crypto life. Just know that you're not storing any coins in your wallet. Your storing the list of addresses that hold your coins and the ability to _spend_ the balances sitting in those addresses. You lose your words and your balances are gone for good.

Best wallets for securing small amounts of BTC  

electrum For Desktop and Android

Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  

Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets, make sure you only upgrade from official sources like play store or https://electrum.org as malicious servers or adverts can tell you to upgrade malware from other sites  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4EhZg5QslI  

Phoenix LN wallets for Android  

Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees. Easiest lightning wallet to use  

Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental and less merchants accept it.  

https://phoenix.acinq.co/  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx5PK1H5OR0  

Breez LN wallet for Android and IOS  

https://breez.technology  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_4b-y4T8bY  

Pros- Lightning network integration(as well as onchain) allowing you to spend with LN merchants for instant confirmations and much lower fees  

Cons- Lightning is still somewhat experimental and less merchants accept it.  

Other Lightning wallets - http://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets  

Blockstream Green Wallet IOS and android wallet  

Pros- Great UX, easy hardware wallet and full node integration, RBF, HW wallet support and advanced 2fa options Cons- Until single signature is released 2 of 2 multisig means that one must depend upon blockstream’s server for tx signing. Other light wallets are dependent upon other servers as well but light wallets like electrum allow you to swap servers.

I would add though, for clarity, some more points of view:

1. You haven't lost anything until you cash out.   
You haven't made anything until you cash out.  
Those who measure their value in cash, should live by the above motto, that way when you feel like you lost $1,000 of profit, you can remind yourself, that you never had that profit because you never cashed it out. And when your Bitcoin is less than you bought it for, you can rest assured that the price fluctuates and you haven't lost your money just yet.
2. You are buying Bitcoin because you value Bitcoin.  
If the price of Bitcoin drops, that's amazing! maybe you can buy more for cheaper!  
If the price of Bitcoin goes up, that's great! you can cash out less of it to fulfil your purchases."

But whatever the case, while Tor can give you better privacy, that doesn't work too well if you're paying for something with a payment method tied to your real identity. You'd have to do something like mail cash or a money order in an envelope with no return address. (Don't mail cash, BTW. It's too easy to steal, and doing so may be illegal.)

Bitcoin isn't anonymous by nature, and anyone who knows you purchased it can track you through the blockchain more easily than you might think. There are features being worked on that would make it at least *closer* to anonymous, but those are still a ways off.

For now, it's a really good idea to mix any you want to try to anonymize.

**Statistically Lump Sum investing will outperform DCA investing.**

DCA is usually the best advice for those that don't have the capital upfront.

For investing in any assets = realty, stocks, bitcoin, or gold the best advice is to make a solid plan after doing your research up front, diversify with uncoorelated asset classes that are properly hedged and invest all up front. This is especially true with Bitcoin because no one can predict the price and most appreciation happens on a few days each year that are unexpected so the quicker you own BTC , the quicker you get exposure to this appreciation.

This being said you should not be investing at all in Bitcoin unless you have paid off all your high interest debt and have at least 3-6 months of fiat in an emergency fund to cover living expenses.

Lump sum investing outperformed DCA investing 68% of the time according to a Vanguard study -

https://www.fool.com/investing/dollar-cost-averaging-what-investors-need-to-know.aspx

2 reasons -

1) stocks (I suggest an index fund like SPDR ) and BTC have an inherent upwards bias so the sooner you invest the quicker you can accumulate appreciation

2) Inflation drag - fiat uninvested will be slowly losing value due to inflation

It's never possible to answer this question. If you look at PlanB's stock2flow model, it becomes obvious that a strategy is to cash-out whenever we overshoot massively, like, 5x.

This would mean - actually pretty high numbers at the moment. You should cash out at

* $50k right now
* $100k at EOY
* $500k at EO2021
* $1m at EO2022

because each of those values are approx. 5x from the ""fair value"".

However, since everyone watches S2F closely, it will probably have an effect on most traders' strategy, so it will likely play out differently. It could for example mean that an expected dip will not happen.

It's better to scale-in and scale-out in small proportions, timing the market is ultimately very hard. And BTC could still go to zero, or a million tomorrow, who knows."

""
Weight units are a measurement used to compare the size of different Bitcoin transactions to each other in proportion to the consensus-enforced maximum block size limit. Weight units are also used to measure the size of other block chain data, such as block headers. As of Bitcoin Core 0.13.0 (released August 2016)[1], each weight unit represents 1/4,000,000th of the maximum size of a block.

Virtual size (vsize), also called virtual bytes (vbytes), are an alternative measurement, with one vbyte being equal to four weight units. That means the maximum block size measured in vsize is 1 million vbytes.

I have used both the Ellipal (v1, not Titan) and the Ledger. Even though I like the Ellipal better because it has a bigger screen and is truly air-gapped, the advantage of the Ledger is that it is very well known and tools usually make sure that they are compatible with it. So you are a lot more flexible with the ledger.

Shameless self-plug here: Our wallet, called ""AirGap"", is very similar to Ellipal, but the whole code is open source and you can install the ""Vault"" (the secure offline app holding your keys) on an old phone (and then put it into airplane mode). Other than that, it's very similar to how Ellipal works. Our app is free, open source and rated ""reproducible"" on walletscrutiny: [https://walletscrutiny.com/android/it.airgap.vault/](https://walletscrutiny.com/android/it.airgap.vault/)

3) Exchange hot wallets are custodial as opposed to non custodial. You should also use open source wallets that are peer reviewed 

Bitcoin is P2P currency. Storing bitcoins on exchanges, banks or web wallets makes you insecure and makes the whole ecosystem insecure indirectly by centralizing bitcoin. 

Bitcoin is a bearer asset with ~immutable txs unlike fiat. This means that internal or external thieves  prefer to target what they can take and won't be reversed like digital fiat. Having centralized exchanges and banks store BTC makes it a desirable target for these attacks. 


There are privacy concerns with storing your bitcoins with third parties

You are exposed to tax theft, asset forfeiture theft , civil theft 

You are exposed to exit theft 

You are exposed to the exchange refusing to support a split asset where they steal it , throw it away, or delaying a payout causing you to lose opportunity costs and profit

You place Bitcoin as a whole under more systemic risk by tempting exchanges to use fractional reserve banking and giving them too much influence

**Never store your bitcoins in a web wallet or exchange . You own 0 bitcoins if you do not control your private keys.**

Lightning payment channels are a way of preapproving many transactions so you get instant ""confirmations"" for lower fees with a single Bitcoin transaction. 

Main Benefits are :

1) Fees for sending Bitcoin are free to a fraction of a penny typically 

2) No waiting around for confirmations. When you send a transaction you get an instant confirmation

3) Transactions are much more private than onchain, so no need for privacy coins or mixing 

There is a catch though!

1) You need to initially get the Bitcoin in a payment channel in most cases unless you are using a service like https://zaphq.io/ or are topping up an existing payment channel or using a custodial solution 

This means that typically the channel creation fee(onchain transaction) is spread across many lightning txs so even if you pay less than a penny per tx using lightning you need to spread the cost of the initial bitcoin fee across those to be fair.

Thus if you pay a low priority fee of lets say 30 cents to preload 500 dollars of Bitcoin in a channel and make 20 txs on lightning to spend that Bitcoin , you essentially will be paying 1.5 cents a tx even though its only a few sats to send BTC in a lightning wallet

Additionally , not all merchants will accept lightning txs. Here are examples of some that do

https://lightningnetworkstores.com/

https://acceptlightning.com/map.html

--------------------------------

There are at least 31 wallets that can send lightning (electrum too not listed below)

https://lightningnetworkstores.com/wallets


The 3 easiest to use IMHO wallets are : 

https://bluewallet.io

https://breez.technology

I can't tell you how many times I've read ""safest is to transfer your bitcoins to hardware wallet"" but you are not transferring anything because those devices only store your private keys. Nothing stops exchanges to freeze you out of your account. Also don't some, if not all, also store your private key (think coinbase does it).

It actually is not misleading, as this is the recommended approach by crypto experts as well as the FAQs of the major crypto subreddits.    

The blockchain actually has the Bitcoin on it.  The private key from your hardware wallet is what gives you and you alone access to it.  When the Bitcoin that you buy is on an exchange, yes you own it in a way, but you are at the mercy of the exchange in terms of fully owning it.    

In terms of the exchange owning your private key, I believe that is if you use their wallet to store your Bitcoins.  Coinbase and others have products like that, but they are usually not recommended as they are usually hot wallets and not cold storage."

You will be competing with market participants that are much better (more informed, access to more data, better emotional state, larger bankroll, better tech etc etc). In order to make money in trading, you have to beat your opponents, AND taxes, AND the trading fees, AND your own self (discipline).  

So you need to ask yourself: what are you doing better than the other participants in the market? If you can't answer this question clearly, you shouldn't be trading. Or if you still really want to, treat it like a gambling hobby (nothing wrong with that, but be clear that it's just gambling with negative odds for your side).  

> What does a wallet do?  

A bitcoin wallet holds your private keys, which is the thing that you need in order to move bitcoin around.   

> Is it possible to pay less tax when buying/selling?  

Ask your tax advisor. Not a question for this sub, as it depends mostly on your jurisdiction and your personal circumstances."
