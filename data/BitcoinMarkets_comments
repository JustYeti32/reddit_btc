I have an 8% position from $32k that I needed to close within a week, and I wanted to re-position before the $50k break. It was tough to call how much of a pullback we're going to get, but I'm pretty happy getting most of what I wanted filled @ 46."

But sentiment-wise, it's way different than last time. Now we have people who stuck around after having 'bought high' who understand what the final impulses of the FOMO can do to the monthly candles. And of course, we have institutional FOMO now, also.

When price hits its newest all time high (like it did last night), it's expected that there'll be some euphoric sentiment in here each time. Pretty reasonable there, IMO."

Instead I have been drooling over one textbook perfect bull flag forming on the daily.  So Sexy! That is one fine piece of chart!

I don't make calls too often but I pride myself on somehow being right more than wrong.  Can I brag for a minute?  I accumulated most of my btc holdings from $800 to $200 back in 2013 or 2014 (too lazy to look at the chart to confirm exact date). I called the Feb bottom in 2019 and was so convinced that we were entering a bullish phase that I quit my job and was going to live on the gains that hadn't happened yet. Luckily for me, I had a hobby that became a small business and I didn't need to withdraw funds from my bitcoin portfolio until I was ready.  I also called the last time btc would hit 4 figures (thus my flair).  Though they weren't all perfect.  I remember I was confident that we were going to hit $10K way before we did and boasted about it on this forum (and was repeatedly put in my place rightfully so).

So here is my latest premonition, we'll see Bitcoin hit $55K by Valentine's day.  I personally have a more aggressive view and think it's going to be a 100% gain in the next 2 weeks but don't want to overextend my prediction with my reputation on the line. So I think it's going to break out of the sexy ass bull flag I mentioned before I went into my self idolizing paragraph and go stratospheric (and then probably drop 30% in a 4 hour flash crash).  That's all for now.  This hit of hopium is on the house.  And if I'm wrong, remember how much I charged you to read this.

Cheers!"

The end game here is way, way off (last coin is mined in 2140) but the end game for us alive today is becoming clear. We will use Bitcoin as a vault of our online digital wealth storage where we can save, spend, invest, and exchange into any other currency on earth 24/7 as needed. It is not restricted to any country or region so it will never be threatened by a digital fiat. 

As this progression continues, sell pressure will mean less and less, because those selling will be met with equal buying pressure as more and more individuals and companies hold some portion of wealth withing the Bitcoin ecosystem. But it is critical to understand that this takes time. Currently a large player can impact the price because their portion of the whole is still in some cases relatively large and triggers additional buy and sell orders and FOMO when they make their move. This ability to influence price will diminish over time if things continue to progress as they are. But again, it will take time. Either way, Bitcoin continues to grow and the price continues to bounce within the restrictions of higher and higher ranges every 3 or 4 years. Bitcoin needs one thing - time."

The world energy market is decidedly not homogenous, and mining is a new, extremely portable way to make use of energy that would otherwise be discarded. I don't know exactly how much is available in that pool, but it's a lot -- quite plausibly 10x what mining currently uses."

Certainly plausible that this could become law prior to 2022 tax year, and it only applies to long term cap gains, so if you bought 10 coins on Jan 1 2021 at 29k or whatever and sell them on Jan 2 2022 for 300k apiece, you would be paying the higher tax rate on the last $10,000 of your 2021 gains (in the first scenario I describe) when filing your April, 2023 taxes. If the second scenario I give is correct, then you would pay LT Cap gains for your 2021-2022 profits in April, 2023 only IF your regular income in 2022 exceeds $1 million, excluding any capital gains. I think that’s the far more likely and reasonable interpretation based on how the tax brackets currently work with long term capital gains"

My first short from 40k could have been done so much better but I clearly underestimated the panic selling that occurred. I had bids at 35k, deribit went to 35260 so I exited on the bounce at 37k only to watch it drop to 30k the rest of the day. Sucks but you win some you lose some.

The reason for this current short, average 37.5k, is that is appears this current bounce is running out of steam. The 4hr volume is dropping again on CBP. OI is actually higher than it was before the drop, meaning there are more longs open now then at 40k, along with funding being pretty high. Usually after a big drop we consolidate for awhile, from a few weeks to a few months. OI and funding, along with the comments in here, show that sentiment is overly bullish. 

There is no reason to immediately expect new highs. I don't think we'll be making a new ATH for at least another week, possibly a month. I don't know if we'll make a new low, either. It's possible, but I, personally, put the odds of making a new low, well, low. Target for short is 35-ish."

On coinbase, the loan term is 25 days and coinbase closes and reopens the loan for the full amount if you leave it open for longer than that.

If I do well for the first 25 days, and then the loan is closed and reopened, will the the price at which liquidation occurs now be higher since the loan was reopened at the time? Or do I get to keep my old liquidation price?

What happens in the usual bull is steady gains turn into a frenzy as retail arrive and then it collapses as everyone realises it can't keep increasing forever. This time the market cap is too big for only individuals to accelerate to the 10x expectations so institutions have to be convinced to get involved. They remove a lot of coin liquidity from the market and let retail build into a frenzy over the scraps of coins on the exchange. The marketcap won't really reflect what each coin is worth but does it matter when they are locked up long term? I don't know.

The MVRV Z-Score is used to assess when Bitcoin is over/undervalued relative to its ""fair value"". When market value is significantly higher than realized value, it has historically indicated a market top (red zone), while the opposite has indicated market bottoms (green zone). Technically, MVRV Z-Score is defined as the ratio between the difference of market cap and realized cap, and the standard deviation of market cap, i.e. (market cap – realized cap) / std(market cap)."

Look at your competition - it's mostly free. What's your niche and be honest - how do you stand out? Plenty of people have Patreon and other services that provide personal service AND experience in trading with serious money behind it.

If you're serious about this - and I'm not sure if you are - then you know that there are literally dozens if not hundreds of free courses out there teaching all this. There are thousands of YouTubers out there showing everyone this. There are hundreds of trading professionals that are selling these courses for less than $25. It's only the popular ones who are selling it for anything above $100 let alone $200 and those people already have 100,000+ followers and they produce hours of content every single day.

If you want middle school then:

* start a YouTube channel (or equivalent)
* post every single day, at least one hour
* go to various social media sites/clubs and participate, offer insight
* gentle reminders to follow you and follow others
* move to a streaming platform and collaborate with others

But you need to work on your niche first. Real time conversation with a person in 2020 is not a niche and hasn't been for over a decade for those who are charging $200.

I'm not trying to torpedo your dream but just to give you some sober advice here. I hope I helped put things into perspective.

Here is what my fundamental analysis says:

- Bitcoin is starting to be accepted by the main stream as a hedge for inflation

- with Democrat sweep and Biden in office, there will be more money printing

- this bull run has been driven by institutional investors

- this is slightly anecdotal, but it feels like institutions are doing whatever possible to hedge against inflation 
which makes me think they know the USD inflation will be higher than expected 

- with all the GME frustration going on, is seems a movement has been reignited against the main stream financial institutions that really started from the back of the 2008 financial crisis. This would be a boost for crypto for obvious reasons

- This range feels very similar to the 2k to 3k range from the last bull run where is took last around 2/3 months before it broke up

- when the price was going up, people were bearish because it was going up too fast

- when the price is going sideways just under the ATH, people are bearish because it isn't ranging high enough/ or going up

I can definitely see your point for thinking the price may go down from here, but not everyone trades on technicals. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish"

Not much change since [my last post](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/infh2r/daily_discussion_sunday_september_06_2020/g48xarj/).

I chose to post a 12 hour instead of daily because the wedge (green lines) we are in on the 12 hour timeframe is ready for break out.  The boll bands (salmon color) have tightened around the recent high and recent low and a higher high or lower low should act is confirmation for a break in the wedge lines (green lines).  I think a close on the 12 hour outside the wedge lines could also be a good time to take an entry playing the break out of the wedge.  

The targets would be the daily and weekly target that I explained in my last post.  [Here is my post](https://old.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/infh2r/daily_discussion_sunday_september_06_2020/g48xarj/) that explains where I get my targets from and more details.  I like those targets I had previously chosen, however, since this trade is on the 12 hour we should consider the 12 hour horizontal levels.  I think 11.7k, the volume node on the 12 hour (purple lines on the right in the chart), might be a better target for upside break out than the daily target of 11.3k from my previous post.   Again, we are trading this on the 12 hour, so I prefer to use horizontal levels from that timeframe.  But significant levels from higher timeframes can be very powerful in lower timeframe trades."

your answer is ""adoption will happen over time"". but how is this an answer at all? it is just belief. an answer that wud maybe convince a sceptic wud start ""here are some reasons why i think ppl will adopt it instead of btc, or fiat, for everyday transactions over time.""

It is a fixed supply asset that is growing at this point due to greater adoption i.e more people buying in to a supply that isn't growing. A short term price rise or fall with this thesis doesn't always need to have a 'reason'.

Which may not sound super valuable at first glance - woo, I get to vote on shit, so what.  
But, of course, one proposal that could be voted on would make the governance token more like a conventional share: some of the profits from Uniswap could be allocated to the token holders.  
Even without carrying out such an action, the potential for doing so gives the tokens value, in much the same way that many stocks are valuable without actually paying any dividends.  
Of course, we can further say that Uniswap doesn't currently have profits. The fees that are collected go to liquidity providers. But (for example) it would be possible to change the operation of Uniswap so that instead of providing 0.3% fees to liquidity providers, it provided 0.29% fees to liquidity providers and 0.01% to a pool that would be distributed to UNI holders.  
With roughly a billion dollars of transactions per day, this would yield a hundred thousand dollars per day in fees, $36.5 million equivalent per year; which would give UNI a kind-of-P/E-ratio of a little under 30.  
All of this is speculative - right now, Uniswap is still competing for market share in a very competitive space. They almost certainly don't have room to be collecting fees for UNI holders without setting things up so that someone else eats their lunch. But since they are currently a leader in the DEX space, we can imagine that the odds of them achieving a dominant position due to first mover advantage are decent. So that one possible outcome sees them doing ten billion dollars per day in volume, two years from now, \*and\* being in a position to collect that 0.01% (or even 0.005%).  
So, yeah. That's why I allocated 3% of my stack to them. Speculative, but unlike many coins, it can answer the question 'How does this make any money, after all is said and done?'. And who knows, decentralized exchanges could be huge.  
There are still more ways to lose than win, though. Don't bet everything on it."

Not that this is anything like that time. The worst that I think happens is that we fall down to 11.6-12k and form another higher low, but it just doesn't look like that will happen yet. It definitely looks like we'll hit 14k before any sort of correction.

* 6hr lower low/downtrend potential

Lower time frames will show a reversal before higher time frames for obvious reasons but higher time frames overrule lower and lower time frames flip flop readily. Kind of a tricky spot here with the 4hr downtrend, but it printed a high volume 4hr bullish pinbar which is a reversal candle.

Speaking just for myself, I moved my remaining USDT to euro this morning. Euro seems likely to continue gaining on USD, and for anyone that has worries about USDT being dodgy, this seems like a no brainer, even without the binance maker fee promo."

You are sleeping in cash and shorting during a bull market with an asset that never closes and you're wondering why you're bleeding money like a sieve. You should definitely get help for gambling addiction, but also recognize one thing. The least risky position is with the trend. Trading counter to the market is almost always a losing bet. You'll always lose over time if you go in margin on intraday trying to short the bull or long the bear."
