Most of us like Litecoin here. Ethereum likely has its use cases as well. However, ethereum is much more centralized in its control and no crypto even approaches the raw computational power supporting the bitcoin network—this power is radically decentralized as well, and these factors underlie the massive security of the bitcoin network. 

As far as your western union comparison, do you really not see all the relevant differences? Western union is imminently censorsble, centralized, requires permission, requires third parties, likely has many problems functioning across borders (I could be wrong on that one). Bitcoin is the antithesis of all of these problems."

At the end of the day, it’s a widget that allows people who want to buy bitcoin to do so. I personally don’t think it’s some huge danger, no more so than recommending a user any standard exchange, or sending them to the forum, etc. It was added to improve the search engine performance of the page, and Moonpay was chosen because it offered the simplest integration and was well designed and fit into the page nicely. Wallets like Breez, Bluewallet, and even Casa wallet use similar widgets (the first two using Moonpay, the later using Wyre). It’s not a big deal.

Blockstream is a bullshit company that keeps putting out products that never want to give users 100% control, even your latest hardware wallet product pushes some crappy “remote secure element” notion. Your recent Aqua wallet has a “Buy Liquid Bitcoin” button right next to a “Buy Bitcoin” one, and sends users to Wyre, which is no different to Moonpay really. It’s also completely unethical to encourage new users that that wallet is targeted towards to buy L-BTC, what the fuck? Nobody should “buy” L-BTC, least of all a newbie, they’re just buying an IOU, they should convert into it, with full understanding of the risks and trade offs. But in that wallet it’s being marketed as a quicker version of Bitcoin, not much different to what Roger does with his wallet. Our wallet won’t mix up assets like that, or have our server as a second key, but no doubt you’ll find some way to smear that too.

The altcoins are more volatile so that argument doesn't make any sense to package them with Bitcoin to reduce volatility.

An ETF only makes sense the way that grayscale makes sense. It allows tax advantaged accounts an easy way to gain exposure. But it still doesn't justify adding altcoins to the mix.
Does allow a Wall Street to collect fees. Trust me,if enough people wanted to trade chicken turds,  Blackrock would mix it with cat turds and make an ETF for it.

ETFs have been The craze for a long time but small individual investors are starting to see through them. Jim Cramer was talking about this the last time I watched him a couple weeks ago. The Robin Hood generation wants to pick winners. Fractional shares also helps small investors build portfolios without ETFs. Honestly the volatility argument doesn't hold as much water as it is supposed to. If a large component in a sector takes a dive, it usually causes everyone in that sector to take a dive. For instance I had an ETF with Boeing in it when they started crashing planes. Owning it inside an ETF did nothing to protect me."

This wording is common in most versions of this question. Instead of vague and ambiguous words, understanding the enormity of the specific numbers would help you  

It depends on the BIP32 derivation paths being used by the specific wallet, and you can probably find some numbers in the BIP32 specification. From memory (not reliable), a seed phrase can generate 2^32 (about 4 billion) keys in each path

I'm really baffled about the lengths bitcoin supporters go to defend and ignore its energy usage. Of course, you can compare it to other financial systems, but you have to be thorough, otherwise it's just an excuse. The arguments I heard so far were for example: ""banks use energy as well"", though banks won't just magically disappear when you use a different currency, financial transactions are just a fraction of what banks do, and also, banks (aka exchanges) are very much part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as well, and those exchanges also use energy. Or: ""fiat currency or credit card processing uses energy as well"", though put in relation with the transaction volume and energy usage per transaction, it's not even close to a comparison.

It'll accellerate until it flys off the rails. By contrast, Bitcoin's block size is it's brakes preventing it from reaching dangerous speeds.

This isn't really true. Bandwidth is a brake, and dynamic PoW is the transaction limiter. An attacking entity would have to pay enormous sums of money to sustain a penny spend attack on the network for long enough for it to matter. Yeah you could flood the network and overwhelm nodes if you had sufficient resources to do so, but the second you stop the attack the nodes will start catching up again and older transactions will start approving. So unless you want to pay a ridiculous amount of money to sustain the attack for weeks on end, this isn't going to result in any significant impact. Further to this, nodes can choose to publish their transaction with a higher PoW to outcompete the cheaply published transactions, if they're urgent. At the end of the day this is no different to a Bitcoin fee market, the only difference is that Bitcoin has throughput constraints due to blocksize and it's linear requirements, where-as Nano is asynchronous. Just FYI, Bitcoin is vulnerable to penny spend attacks and their impact would be a lot worse on Bitcoin than on Nano. 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04842.pdf

With BTC miner's have monetary incentive to congest the network. This is a serious problem. Mining cartels essentially set their own fees, and lone participants can cause havoc in the markets by inflating the fees to absurdly high prices.

> Have you ever used the lightning network? It is quite usable. Liquidity requirements are easily achieved. Its easy enough (and cheap enough) to pay for liquidity. 

I don't agree here at all. Lykke had this exact problem: https://medium.com/@Mikhail.Nikulin/lightning-network-why-it-wont-work-64d1762beee4 - If you want to onboard your customers without having to settle on-chain you have to have access to high liquidity to sustain them. For every dollar your customers spend, you need to match in liquidity. If your customers are processing a billion dollars of transactions a month you need to have a billion dollars of liquidity at the ready a month, at minimum. That's a ridiculous requirement. If you don't want to do on-boarding like this and would prefer customers fund their own liquidity then they have to settle their initial transactions on-chain to create channels, at the cost of the value of the goods they want to spend. For single use transactions, this is entirely pointless, you're back to just use Bitcoin and paying a large fee and having slow transaction times. For small transactions its like depositing funds into a ""coffee bank"", where you say: ""I'll put $500 here, and every day I'll use a piece of it to buy a coffee"". The issue with this is now your liquidity is tied up and can't be reinvested. In a normal world that $500 would be sitting in a bank account earning you interest. In Lightning Network world you've locked that money down so you can spend a piece of it at an interval. Why would I ever want to do that? 

That's without covering all of the complexities involved in using LN from a UX/UI perspective as well, and the potential problems with routing, path finding, path latency, online requirements, watch towers and whatever else. This is also not covering all of the LN vulnerabilities (flood and loot attacks, griefing attacks, pinning and time-dilation attacks, etc), some of which are not fixable without changes to the way Bitcoin's core protocol works. LN is a bandaid on top of Bitcoin's bottleneck constraints, is full of design weaknesses and vulnerabilities due to the restrictions imposed by the core protocol, and unfortunately it's restrictions make it untenable for mass consumption. Nothing compares to Nano right now from a pure currency angle. It's entire philosophy is do one thing, and do it best. I have no problem with the idea of Bitcoin being the SoV, but we still need a decentralized p2p currency and second layer solutions are not adaquete for that."

Because when you spend it or convert it back to cash you may owe taxxes. Since you are on visa, I think you might want to be extra careful on what you owe the man (the government). If you are already aware of this then completely disregard this post, if not please read.

Take this scenerio:

You earned $100 from working your job as a \_\_\_\_\_, after taxxes you kept say $75. 

You convert $75 to 75 DigiCoins (or BTC or whatever Crypto, lets use DigiCoins for simplicity lol).

Say your 75 digicoins are now worth $100 USD. If you bought a $100 monitor, you would owe the government maybe around $5 ($25 x YY%=$5) in taxxes. This is because your 75 digicoins increased in value to $100 USD (from when you bought to when you spent). So you incurred $25 in capital gains which you have to tax at a certain percent. **This is because US tax code treats Crypto as a commodity and is subject to capital gains tax EVEN IF USED AS A CURRENCY.**

P.S. The $5 i said is just an example, it depends on if you had a short term holding or long term holding and where you fall in the tax bracket.

P.S.S. If your 75 digicoins lost value and is now worth $70usd. And then you bought a $70 monitor, you would owe 0 in additional taxxes because you suffered a capital loss (not gain)."

I personally think both are going to do well over the next year, and your money would be well spent on either. I'd recommend bitcoin (of course) for the following reasons:

1) The risk of failure for bitcoin is very low, as the core protocol changes very conservatively. Eth meanwhile will be transitioning to Eth 2.0, which opens up a lot of unknowns and potential problems.

2) Bitcoin's hard cap and mining rewards will never change, so we can be sure that there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. Ethereum's eventual model is a lot less clear. If it ends up being inflationary, long term holds will depreciate over time. 

3) It seems that the institutional interest for bitcoin is much higher than that for Eth, or in other words more buyers with stronger hands.

4) Perhaps this is more subjective, but I'm more convinced of bitcoin's value proposition than ethereum's."

 Bitcoin is starting its journey to being a trusted asset and until mass adoption its value will only increase.

For me the top criteria in choosing a wallet are, in this order:

1. (tie) Non-custodial. This is because ... [Not your keys](https://notyourkeys.org), [not your bitcoin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt-zXEsJ61U).
2. (tie) Open source, [verifiable release](https://walletscrutiny.com/#tableofwallets)
3. [Replace-by-fee](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee) (RBF) support
4. [Coin Control](https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Coin_control) ([for maintaining Financial Privacy](https://medium.com/@nopara73/coin-control-is-must-learn-if-you-care-about-your-privacy-in-bitcoin-33b9a5f224a2), but also for [child-pays-for-parent](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fee_bumping) (CPFP) fee bumping).

Generally recommended wallets are:

> Hardware wallet (highest security): [Coldcard](https://coldcardwallet.com), [Trezor](https://trezor.io) or [BitBox02](https://shiftcrypto.ch/bitbox02)

> Desktop wallet: [Electrum](https://electrum.org), [Wasabi](https://wasabiwallet.io)

> Android wallet: [Samourai Wallet](https://samouraiwallet.com), [Electrum](https://electrum.org), [Blue Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.bluewallet.bluewallet) (with Lightning functionality)

> iPhone wallet: [Blockstream Green](https://blockstream.com/green), [Blue Wallet](https://itunes.apple.com/app/bluewallet-bitcoin-wallet/id1376878040), or [Aqua](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1500791973)

Go look at the Bitcoin chart from Apr-Aug 2017 on the monthly, then open another tab and look at the monthly from Oct 2020 - Feb 2021. 

Tell me how eerily similar they look. 5 green monthly candles with the same massive green candle into ATH and the second local top of a bull cycle. 🤔

Then, notice how BTC had a red September in 2017, which will be March for us now (if the trend continues of course) and in 2017 BTC used the first local top of $3k as a support during that correction. Of course, there are assumptions at ply here, but one thing that isn’t an assumption is that a red candle needs to be printed sooner than later on the monthly charts, and it would likely be healthiest to have it in March, honestly. 

We’ll see though, it’s definitely an interesting comparison and as we know, BTC likes to repeat this 4 year trend. The difference this time however being that we’re 6 months early and people won’t want to hear that the bull run might end in the summer instead of the winter. March and the following months (if they look/feel like Oct-Dec 2017) should be very telling."

ASICs have costs, and have historically self-obsoleted pretty fast. In fact, these hardware costs are significant. It's a falsity that electricity dwarfs all other costs. It's difficult to say how well the next generation will perform, or when it will be released, but in a professional setting they can *usually* be expected to double your money. The first 3-6 months, depending on how early you get in, will pay for the unit. The next 6-12 months will pay again. After a year or two, they usually aren't worth running professionally, and don't have much resale or scrap value either. The good news is that there's not a specific number to invest, each machine can basically be thought of individually, if you ignore costs like networking equipment and time spent managing. The numbers work for $1,000 just the same as $100,000.

So, if one buys a 2nd gen ASIC, takes two months to set it up, and then operates at only 80% uptime, for example taking days to fix a networking or power issue, the breakeven grows to infinity, even with free electricity. Sure, given enough time you'll always make money, but the timeline might be well beyond you've turned to dust.

Mining at home has other challenges. The heat and noise are easy to dismiss, but a few racks of machines is basically equivalent to having an open oven running with a leafblower on top. I know of people who received sound ordinances from relatively modest garage setups. Attempting to insulate the noise can result in heat issues - these things love airflow.

Anyways, best thing to do is wait til a new generation of ASICs comes out, and do everything in your power to obtain units quickly without a lot of markup. Overnight them from China or whatever you need to do. Get them setup quickly and manage them closely, especially for first couple months.

Or try GPU mining instead, it's way more forgiving, since there are many options to mine on and the hardware has resale value. Doesn't particularly matter what you're mining so long as it makes profit, since you can always swap into BTC."

Being closer to Coinbase than the average person actually turned me even more against it, because it is worse than what the outside world suspects Coinbase does.

But don't forget this is the trading world - it's unscrupulous. The IPO will be successful (will also be frontrun by a major bank) and lots of folks will get rich. Luckily, I for one think one would get even richer by putting the same money in BTC. Money is always a better argument."

Tracing a single bitcoin may be impossible generally (if my account has 10 and I send 1 to you, which of my 10 was it?  What if I received them all in 0.4 increments from 25 people?)  But tracing identities of owners, and even to some extent poison coin tracing, is definitely possible, and done today.

For identity tracing, most people these days get their coins from KYC/AML exchanges, meaning the government can and will put names to addresses.  And from there, A buys from an exchange and sends to B (who is unknown to exchanges and government), A is now in a predicament.  He either proves somehow B's address isn't his, and pays tax on the settlement, or is unable/unwilling to prove it, and now pays tax when B spends the coin later, and is also on the hook if B does something nefarious with the coin that can be traced.

For poison tracing, there is already a good technical method that, while not perfect, does show poison coins circulating among ne'er-do-wells, which will lead to blacklist addresses that payment processors and online retailers will probably be forced to check before accepting payments.  This is not 1984 scifi either, it is already done in traditional fiat payment processing.  The same method would be utilized here, though it could be even more extensive -- bank accounts are black and white, match or don't match.  Crypto addresses are black, gray and white, since a government can decide how sensitive to potential laundering activity it wants to be.  It could for example say ""This political dissident + gray account -> rejected"".

Finally, Amazon and Google and all those guys will have your ID and crypto address(es) if we get to that stage.  We have precedent that the government can ask for that data, and it will receive it.

This in concert with poison coin tracing technology will make it quite a bit easier for a government to know with good certainty who various people are, should they need to.

To guard against this, I guess it would be good for A and B to treat the source and destination addresses in a transaction as burners, meaning A never uses the source again (done by many wallets already), and B created the public address only for A to send to that 1 time."

Well, it's pretty simple:

1. someone sets up a website promising HUGE GAINS if you invest
2. you move your BTC to that person's control
3. that person's website shows you steadily increasing HUGE GAINS for as long as you keep your coins there
4. when you ask for your gains to be returned to you, that person stalls and puts up roadblocks
5. eventually that person has defrauded enough people and simply disappears
6. you're left wondering why you put yet more money into yet another scam

If it becomes better than all others, people will just fork it, change a few parameters to make it better, and launch it. If it's closed source, then it's centralized, it's run by an entity which controls it, and that defeats the purpose of being a cryptocurrency. So being technological superior is not as important as some people think and most of the times is just marketing.



Bitcoin has unconditional scarcity and decentralization. I said unconditional scarcity and not just scarcity because some people say ""CDs are scarce too nowadays and that doesn't make then valuable"". Sure, but if the market price of CDs increases, its production increases, thereby lowering the price. With bitcoin, production can't increase, it always decreases (it halves every four years). Decentralization is important too, because if something is scarce but is owned in big part by some entity, you have to trust that entity not to sell it and not to use its profits to launch another new cryptocurrency, thereby reducing its scarcity. Many altcoins, if not all, market themselves as decentralized when they are not. In short, bitcoin is digital gold. Like gold, it's decentralized and scarce. Actually bitcoin will be even scarcer than gold in 3.5 years.


Any question just shoot."

The problem with bitcoin is, that the people who hold the majority of the bitcoins are super rich assholes who don't give a fuck about what bitcoin is ""supposed"" to be all about, and are just treating this like another way to get rich. They strategically cash out now and then, so that they can buy even more bitcoin when the price goes down, because they know that the stupid fucking masses will keep buying bitcoin no matter what because they are fucking idiots, which they then exploit to become even more rich, until they finally decide to cash out that one last time before they retire in the bahamas. This is literally just a goddamn pyramid scheme for the rich to play around with, just like stocks are. Think about it, you know all those articles that say that the one percenters own 90 percent of all the stocks? They own all the fucking stocks because they fucking know the stupid fucking idiot masses won't be able to ever control themselves enough to not ""try their luck"" with the stocks. Poor people constantly try to stop being poor with various pyramid schemes because they're fucking poor and desperate and are willing to try almost anything that will make them stop being fucking poor, it's like with gambling, poor people gamble way more than more well of people, because they are desperate for some way to get out of their terrible situation in life and the rich are goddamn fucking well aware of that and are constantly exploiting that psychological phenomenon. Whether we're talking booze, cigarettes, junk-food or stocks, it's all the fucking same. Who do you guys think this hurts, when bitcoin's price goes down, exactly? It hurts the little people, since the rich are the ones who cause this fucking loopy roller-coaster. They cash out and laugh, and then bitcoin's price drops like a fucking rock and starts it's slow climb all over again to where it was before the rich decided to fuck with it. And you guys think that this system is stable and will last?? Bitcoin's a fucking joke, it's just legalized theft, it's wealth redistribution, it's a system the rich use to take poor people's money, and the fucking idiots give the rich their money completely willingly. Think about it, this system can literally only function for as long as people are willing to play along. The second people think this system is fucking bullshit and stops buying bitcoin, this entire fucking system collapses and bitcoing becomes worth nothing and you all end up losing all your money!

Hold on to your 23 BTC, at some point it might mean something like a BTC can be equal to a one voice or something. Idk. Or use it for something greater like helping the those who needs it the most. For now, this 23 BTC is giving you enough power to do something bigger. It may not be what you initially intend it to be, but still it pave way to something good.

Another point, and the reason I referred to it as a nuclear button, is that because there is such a huge mountain of government, corporate and even personal debt now, deflation will act as kryptonite/dynamite/atomic bomb to the economy as a whole, as debts will be revalued up to cripplingly high levels (at higher interest rates), and a wave of straight defaults will follow - kind of like the 1930s depression.

I cannot predict exactly what the Fed or other CBs will do in future, however; many believe hyper-inflation is a far more likely prospect than any deflation, perhaps for the above reason, so will hedge against it, particularly by buying precious metals and bitcoin."

For small amount of funds a mobile bitcoin wallet is fine. For large amounts use a hardware wallet.

An exchange is different than a bitcoin wallet. Do a small withdrawal at first to learn how to use a bitcoin wallet. I would recommend Blue Wallet https://bluewallet.io/ for a new-coiner like you. bitcoin is a permissionless technology that allows you to take full ownership. You can buy bitcoin on an exchange and withdraw. Leaving it there means that they, at a technical level, own the coins. Every time you login you are asking big daddy for permission. READ CAREFULLY. Holding bitcoin yourself has a simple but easy to fuckup rule. NEVER share the 12/24 words that the wallet tells you to write down. Those words are used to sign off any transaction of coins you own. ALSO, don’t forget/be lazy. Write them down. Check it once. Check it twice. Check it again. As you progress your journey, learn about transaction fees, bitcoin blocks, running a full node. And about a privacy focused wallet such as Samourai wallet.

BEWARE OF SCAMS  

Do not share your 12/24-words seed with anyone, including in any website, form, or google doc, no matter how official it looks.

Volatility measured by variance is not the appropriate measure of a store of value. A better measure of how good a store of value bitcoin is would be the [semi deviation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/semideviation.asp), which doesn't punish an asset for having large upward movements. Bitcoin has proven itself to be an excellent store of value on the granularity of 1 year. The likelihood that your bitcoin will be worth significantly less in a year than it is today is not large. Looks like basically if you bought bitcoin on a random day, a year later you'd have about a 10% chance that your bitcoin is worth less than 90% of what you bought it for. Lengthen that time span to 2 years and that percentage drops to maybe 1 or 2%."

basically, transactions were included based on which one was received first, so a double spend would be unlikely to propagate through the network faster than the original. in today's world where transactions are prioritized by fee, this no longer works.

but now we have the lightning network which is working to solve this exact problem through payment channels. a merchant can process thousands of transactions via lightning and then settle up the balance on chain at the end of the day (or whenever).

as others have mentioned, you can also accept payments with 0 confirmations. for micro transactions, this is *generally* okay as the only person who can submit a double spend is the original customer and you know who they are now. its the same risk restaurants take with giving you your food before you've paid in cash. you can always dine and dash but you can only get away with this a few times before people identify you as a bad actor.

buying things online makes it harder to catch bad actors, but i can't think of many examples where it would be necessary to transact instantly without waiting for at least one confirmation. if it is necessary, use lightning."

The days of stupid rulemakers are coming to an end, which is why California's proposed bitlicense legislation - modeled after NY's regulation (the NY bitlicense, a regulation, not a law), failed to pass the Legislature several years in a row. Because even in this state (CA), people were smart enough to see that most legislators promoting this sort of shit are asshats.  Meanwhile, an alternate, and totally superior legislative scheme was passed into law in crypto - in Wyoming, which (rather than create stupid anti-innovation mandates issued by Treasury dopes who only know how to develop depressing economic situations), developed a Wyoming system where you could opt-in to one or more of their permit arrangements.

And then there is Mnuchin, who is on his way out from the Treasury, and leaves us with this garbage. There is nothing bullish about it. It's just a pain in the ass. Nobody asked for it, nobody wants it, nobody needs it. It creates no new opportunity, contrary to the very words you so ridiculously typed.

So it probably is OK that the voucher from Amazon goes to your e-mail, I believe.  But do not send the code through anything except the Chat message tool within your trade.

Also, do not do this until after the seller's bitcoin has been escrowed.

You just described **fiat**. It's designed to be too risky to hold long-term because the fat cats want everyone to pump up the stock market and to buy government bonds. But they do want it to be just stable enough that pricing goods and services in fiat terms is acceptable, so the fiat currency stays at the forefront of everyone's mind."

Essentially argues that a model with diminishing returns over time fits the data better and makes more sense given that each successive bull run should be slightly less intense than the one before it.

While Plan B's S2F is a true ""bull case"" I think ""diminishing returns"" is a more measured attempt at forecasting price."

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.

- https://coinatmradar.com <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- [Yap.cx](https://yap.cx) (💵) Montreal, Quebec, Canada
- [Coin Nerds](https://coinnerds.ca) (💵) Mississauga, Ontario, Canada
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

In the above link, are voucher sellers.  Vouchers can be usually purchased with cash, by anyone, and then redeemed by anyone who submits KYC.  Since this does not involve bank account info or anything, perhaps you can buy the voucher, and have a person you trust redeem the voucher on an account of their own, and sent the BTC to you.   Vouchers:

- [FastBitcoins](https://fastbitcoins.com/#locations) (💵)
- [Rise Wallet](https://www.risewallet.com/locations) (💵)
- [Flexepin](https://www.flexepin.com/sales_outlet_finder) (Debit card or 💵) ([Bitaccess](https://bitaccess.ca/buy-bitcoin-with-flexepin-voucher), [MyBTC.ca](https://mybtc.ca/buy-bitcoin-with-flexepin-canada), [Canadian Bitcoins](https://www.canadianbitcoins.com) & [Crypto Voucher](https://cryptovoucher.io/redeem-now)) 
- [Neosurf](https://www.neosurf.com/en_GB/application/findcard) (💵) ([BitIt](https://bitit.io))

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option. There are No-KYC payment methods: In-person cash trade, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, [cash-in-the-mail](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cc9izx), [postal money order](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cc9izx/cash_by_mail_an_underutilized_way_to_buy_bitcoin/etlbuq1), and prepaid gift card.  There are sellers on the P2P exchanges who accept these payment methods.

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover), [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, r/GiftCardExchange, and r/GCTrading). Most of these payment methods will require identity verification / KYC though.

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**, requires browser extension], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less, not available in U.S.], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Switchere](https://switchere.com), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama [KYC]). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.


Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method. Most of these payment methods will require identity verification / KYC though.

- https://exchangewar.info <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)

There's always the friends and family methods.  Someone you know probably holds bitcoin and would be willing to help you out by selling to you."

Anyone on earth could live comfortably forever just by putting it all into an index fund and drawing out 3% every year on January 1st. That's not an advanced strategy, just the most idiot-proof if you have that amount of money.

Most people won't do that. They will first set aside some for a new car. Nothing fancy, just a brand new lexus with all the options. Then they'll get themselves some fun things, bit of a spending spree because they can, they're rich now and a few tens of thousands doesn't change much - they still have millions.

Now, why stay in this house / apt? No reason. Drop $1.5m on a nice place with a garage to match that lexus. Ok, after furniture and some upgrades and a cool back yard setup it's time to invest the rest.

There's still quite a lot, and all this money really validates people so they will invest in stuff like whatever their friend says is a hot stock, and that's how the money pile starts to go down. They might 'lend' some to family and friends to help them out because they're kind. That money is now gone forever.

Next year the tax-man cometh and takes a huge chunk. Investments aren't doing well, they were supposed to grow, and nobody is paying back those loans. Insurance and property tax weren't planned for and now there's fuck-all left from that $3.6m pile. If this person does well, it's because they were already great at managing their money.

26540,gpfgbn5,t1_gpfeq8v,1614702328.0,lvmjz5,Bitcoin,2,False,False,"Most people can lose their job through no fault of their own.  Typically, when a person gets laid off, the entire ""economy"" is sagging, thus, jobs are scarce and the number of job seekers is spiking.  It can take many months, even longer to find work.  During that time, people still have expenses.  

Prior to COVID, if you couldn't pay rent/mortgage you got tossed out.  

Getting tossed out sucks, and it makes it even harder to find a new job.  

Suppose you've put most of your money into one or more investments.  Well, the ""economy"" is sagging, and so are the prices of investments, typically.  This means a person might need to sell at a loss.  It probably also means that by the time a person has found work and is back on their feet, so to speak, the prices of their investments have shot back up.  So, they'll typically take a hit that way.  

Then there's the mental anguish, the stress side.  When you lose your job and you have little or no savings, it sucks a LOT more than when you say, ""Okay.  I have a year or two to find a job.""  I've been in both boats, more than once, each.  I know.  I would NEVER go back to living paycheck to paycheck, with or without investments."

However, in order to implement relative locktimes (which you need for indefinite-lifetime offchain updateable cryptocurrency systems, aka channels), existing MimbleWimble projects overloaded the kernels to contain the equivalent of `nSequence` and `nLockTime`, which prevents sinking signatures from working.

My (possibly wrong) understanding as well is that sinking signatures might be borked, though nobody has really made a decent follow-up / close study of sinking signatures to check if it is borked or not, because nobody ended up using it anyway.

Finally, as I mentioned in [a discussion on confidential transactions](https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/izj4a3/technical_confidential_transactions_and_their/), it would be possible to either have uncontrolled inflation, or reveal historical amounts.  It is better to hide historical amounts (which is exactly what cut-through ***is***, it is the complete loss of historical data), since history never really leaves you, but that means that ***if*** (***IF***) quantum computers can hack SECP256K1 then we have uncontrolled inflation and the death of the supply limit.  So it might be wise to cordon off any NIWA or MimbleWimble into a separate area / extension block, to protect against quantum loss.  This is probably easier as well to softfork in."

Aside from a few Austrians, no economist believes that a fixed supply currency can support a growing economy. You need credit, you need velocity, you need inflation. There is a reason we ditched gold and later gold based IOUs, and our current system of credit based fiat money is not inherently broken.  Policies may be breaking it, but thats another discussion.

Bitcoin may displace fiat temporarily or locally if there is a major financial crisis or an overly oppressive government;  sort of a plan B. 

It will also disrupt gold and bond markets as a store of value.  It may disrupt money transmission services (western union and the like) or be used for things like oil purchases between untrusting countries. It may find new technological niches, like autonomous EVs and solar panels and home batteries paying each other.

As we tackle scalability, I also believe it will become a base layer for a lot of applications, many we havent even thought of yet. Basically any alt coin ever would work better and be more secure if it was implemented as a layer on top of bitcoin (or a layer on top of a layer like LN ) or a sidechain of bitcoin.

I deeply regret ever mentioning interest in Bitcoin publicly, to my friends, etc. I felt this in 2017 when all my old friends and coworkers started texting me out of the blue when bitcoin hit 20k. 

Now I work professionally in the space and there's no going back now. If I could time travel I would have stacked sats quietly and avoided talking about Bitcoin the same way people avoid talking about religion. I'm envious of the paranoid cypherpunks that had the foresight to do this since the beginning. Or even the pre-coiners that have a fresh start.

I think the least prepared are the people you see on Twitter that celebrate every small move and news story about Bitcoin. It's easy to get excited. But they'll either sell too early or get overwhelmed with unnecessary attention some day. Be careful what you wish for!"

(as you know ... ) What you could do is follow Dollar Cost Averaging. That's where you spread your buys over a certain period of time. e..g, 6 months, you buy $50 each month, to get you investing your target of $300 (for an example).

If the exchange rate goes down from here, great, your average price for your position will be less than ~$15K per BTC. If the exchange rate goes up from here, great, you got at least some at ~$15K per, which you wouldn't have gotten had you sat on the $300 for six months and bought all at once then.

There's still the risk of it going down after you purchase, but this strategy is one that works for many who struggle with FOMO or who stress over trying to time the market.

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**, requires browser extension], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less, not available in U.S.], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Switchere](https://switchere.com), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama [KYC]). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/locations)) <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations <-- Cashier (cash), ATM (cash or debit card), Kiosk (debit card), and from any 7-Eleven, CVS, & Rite Aid -- [20,000 locations in the U.S.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitcoin-on-every-block-use-cash-to-purchase-bitcoin-with-libertyx-at-20-000-retail-locations-including-major-convenience-store-and-pharmacy-chains-301081111.html)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover), [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, r/GiftCardExchange, and r/GCTrading).


You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

The transaction you build will forever sit there until you sign it. If you decide not to send you can just delete the transaction or simply never broadcast it. 

Remember once the coins are on your coldcard you will need to boardcast ever transaction if using airgapped mode or sign it on the device if plugged in.

Yes, I got that, I wasn't accusing you of being a troll or anything.  I thought it was funny that they were so eager to fellate you for posting it.

> Regarding what you said, I understand what you are saying about secrecy - the blockchain is public - but I think they mean that you can’t tell who actually owns a wallet. So it’s easy to hide money because the wallet isn’t connected to a real person or company.

Analytics can track things down pretty well, though.  KYC/AML policies at exchanges also make it highly traceable.  There are ways to obtain it without KYC, like time-traveling back to 2016, but they're not exactly easy.  Oh, and what else is anonymous?  Hmm, ever paid for anything using cash?  Ever seen those photos from Mexican drug cartel raids where there are enormous stacks of cash all bundled up?

> if a single bitcoin transaction does use the same power as 18 homes in a day that is obscene - surely you can see how that is an issue?

How much energy does the traditional banking sector use in a year?  All those buildings, all those employees shuttling back and forth to work?  Computers and fiberoptics and communications?  Printing and mailing credit card statements, processing checks?  How many trees die every year to make wood pulp for dollar bills?

Did Nutmeg's analysis include the Lightning Network?  (Hint: no, it didn't.)  How would a Bitcoin economy mostly running on LN compare to credit cards and cash?

Did Nutmeg's analysis include sidechains like Liquid?  (Hint: no, it didn't.)  How about total or partial custodial solutions like (total) PayPal and (partial) Square/CashApp?  (Hint: no, it didn't.)

Did Nutmeg bother to check that maybe a lot of that energy used for Bitcoin was waste energy that would otherwise go completely unused?  (Hint: no, they didn't, and yes, it is -- using oilfield flare gas is now a thing, and that just gets dumped straight into the atmosphere either way, may as well use the energy for mining Bitcoin instead of just flaring off the gas for no purpose whatsoever.)

And the most important question: why are miners incentivized to use so much energy to mine Bitcoin?  (Hint: because it's PROFITABLE even using that much.)

The leftards throw out their false ""energy usage"" FUD for EVERY industry they don't like.  Did you know that nuclear power is heavily subsidized because (gasp!) they get to use public roads to move construction equipment around on when building plants?  Did you know that coal power is heavily subsidized because (gasp!) someone built actual railroads so that coal could be moved around from mines to plants?  And yet when you point out that government directly pays electric utilities to build windmills, not even to mention that the blades and turbines get moved on those exact same fucking railroads and roads, the leftards just say ""oh that's perfectly normal and besides we want wind.""

They pull the same crap with farming -- ""oh no, the government lets cattle ranchers graze their cows on government-owned land!"" So what?  The government makes rental fees off that.  ""Oh but that's a SUBSIDY!""  No it isn't, the government is CHARGING the ranchers.  ""BUT THEY COULD CHARGE MORE AND MAKE IT UNECONOMICAL TO SAVE THE COWS!""  But then there wouldn't be any cows because no one is going to raise them if they can't graze them cheaply.  ""Well then they could grow soybeans to feed everyone tofu!""  But your plants can't grow in the desert, that's why it's fucking desert you morons. ""I don't care, I just don't want anyone eating meat!""

It's just a bullshit argument that they try to use for every goddamned thing.  Change a few keywords, spin it a little, roll it out and start SCREAMING IT IN EVERYONE'S EARS UNTIL THEY CAPITULATE to shut up the raving loonies.

I sincerely hope you never eat meat.  Or own pets, especially cats, which are murderous little monsters that kill millions of wild birds every year.  Or wear clothing made with polymer blends.  Or drive a vehicle using internal combustion engine.  Or drive a vehicle that relies on electricity from a fossil-fuel plant or a nuclear plant.

The regulator who comes with these rules is the Dutch National Bank ( De Nederlandse Bank). Who on earth would make a bank the regulator of crypto firms?

So for me it's all a bit of the same bs. Now it's Bitmex, which one is next? 

Please explain why they react here, and not with banks laundering 2Trillion USD for almost 2 decades?

Please explain why at least since 2008 not a single banker was trialed, convicted or went to jail?

All the fraud (the list and fines are endless) and when they screw up, the taxpayer picks up the tab.

So yeah, fuck all regulators, KYC and AML is a pile of horseshit. Makes us jump through hoops when we want to buy a couple of hundred dollar bitcoin, but if you show up at a bank as a cartel boss, dictator or terrorist and you bring millions you get VIP treatment and they succeed in laundering the money for them for years in a row.

Good reply in general, but I especially wanted to highlight this.  The only relevance of social media is that social media stuff are yet more communications channels, and using more communications channels in parallel can make our ability to communicate more robust.  Unfortunately, the ad-revenue driven distortions on popular ""social media"" platforms make them pretty miserable ... but in a pinch even smoke signals will let people communicate when something really needs to be communicated."

A Digital USD would immediately have a market cap of $5-6Trillion and mass adoption by 400M users presumably running over the Visa lightening network.  BTC on the other hand has a market cap of about $200B and spotty adoption.  This I just one example. China is also reported to be ready to launch a digital yuan.  With digitized money being more prevalent there is the risk of crypto falling to the wayside.  It is doubtful that these CBDC will be allowed to play on the crypto sandbox and this will start to pinch off new investment.

The simple answer is that nobody knows. I and many others who have been in the space a while were cautioning others yesterday that a correction was becoming more and more likely the longer we stayed hovering below the previous ATH without breaking through.

Hour-to-hour, day-to-day, the volatility on these scales is simply too difficult to predict due to a lot of ""noise"". Zoom out and look at the weekly charts with a 20-week moving average and take note of the way it supported the bull run back in 2017, and is continuing to support it now.

TLDR: yes we will go back up, but we are likely to move further down or sideways in the short term.

Dinosaurs and other primitive animal species are only aware of their own physical needs, and so they only are able to function competitively (a zero-sum market).  But us social animals have a higher level of awareness, where we're naturally able to understand and be motivated to serve others' needs as well as our own, and use our creativity (emotional, intellectual, and/or philosophical) and collaborative functions to find novel solutions to using the resources we have to serve our individual needs, collectively.  This is a positive sum non-market game, where entirely new resources are generated out of ""nothing"" essentially: as in building buildings to serve the shelter needs of whole families and communities, or inventing and producing computers to serve the whole species' communication needs.

Right now our ""official"" humans governments are the dinosaur type, using point scoring games (elections, grades, income) to pit individuals and groups against on another, so that most human and other Earthlings' needs are not served at all, or poorly.

Well, anyone who spends ten minutes of research realizes (or should realize) that there are significant risks with bitcoin as an investment.

But, you know those cranks saying a bitcoin priced at anything below $1M is a steal?

They might not be wrong.

You seem to be measuring bitcoin like it is just another asset -- or maybe about it dropping 40%,  or something.   But there's also the possibility for a 50X rise. Because it isn't just some alternative to investing in $QQQ or a 10 year Treasury.  

If we had eyes on the future ... we would find that bitcoin will be worth either $1M or it will be worth $0.   We can anticipate bitcoin displacing certain things, opening entirely new other things, etc. ... and project out that if those were to happen, a bitcoin would be $1M or more, each.  

Every day is the fight between corroborating information (institutional investment coming, traction as a spending currency, etc.) or countering information (Dear dog, China Ban Bitcoin!, AGAIN).

A $16,200 price today is simply today's market assessment of where all those risks stand relative to the potential rewards."

Security Advisory
---------------------
Concerning wallet software and hardware-wallet firmware, they must at all time satisfy the requirement of **reproducible-build** verifiability:

>[reproducible-builds.org](https://reproducible-builds.org/)  
>
> Reproducible builds. Why does it matter?
>
> Whilst   anyone may inspect the source code of free and open source software  for  malicious flaws, most software is distributed pre-compiled with no   method to confirm whether they correspond.  
>  
>  
>This   incentivises attacks on developers who release software, not only via traditional exploitation, but also in the forms of political influence,   blackmail or even threats of violence.

The wallet application, and the operating system on which it runs, must be reproducible-build, turtles all the way down.

The only software solution that currently satisfies the requirements of the reproducible-build standard is:

**wallet software** 

- Electrum
- Bitcoin Core Qt

**Linux operating system distros** 

- Debian
- Linux Mint Debian Edition (LMDE)
- Tails
- Arch
- Alpine


>[https://packages.debian.org/sid/utils/electrum](https://packages.debian.org/sid/utils/electrum)  
Package: electrum (4.0.2-2)  
Easy to use Bitcoin client
This   package provides a lightweight Bitcoin client which protects you from   losing your bitcoins in a backup mistake or computer failure. Also,   Electrum does not require waiting time because it does not download the   Bitcoin blockchain.

Installation instructions for Debian-based distros:

$ sudo apt-get install electrum

**Concerning hardware wallets**, in theory **Trezor** comes preinstalled with reproducable-build firmware.

**Other hardware wallets** do not even satisfy the requirements of the reproducible-build software engineering standard.

The user would have to verify upon arrival of the shipment of his Trezor hardware wallet that the firmware was not tampered with during production or shipping, by running the commands mentioned in the following page:


https://wiki.trezor.io/Developers_guide:Deterministic_firmware_build


Since the user will almost surely not make the effort to do that, there is no guarantee that his Trezor wallet will contain the uncorrupted reproducible-build firmware. Given this reality, hardware wallets are a wholly unsuitable approach to the Bitcoin storage security problem except for the technically most savvy and sophisticated users. For ordinary users, hardware wallets must be considered to be a dangerous ambush.

Furthermore, the use of a hardware wallet could literally be a death warrant for its users.

[Crypto Wallet Provider Ledger Hacked: Customer Database Said to be Compromised](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/12/170498-crypto-wallet-provider-ledger-hacked-customer-database-said-to-be-compromised)

>December  21, 2020. Ledger stated yesterday that they have been alerted to the  dump of a customer database on Raidforum. Ledger reports more than 1.5  million wallets have been sold since 2014.

This will inevitable result in a good number of notorious so-called $5 wrench attacks.

In general, every database that contains names and addresses of confirmed Bitcoin owners, such as also the customer database of Coinbase or even the IRS, is a lethal risk to people mentioned in the database.

Avoiding KYC is a necessity: https://kycnot.me

Let's say I make 100k a year after taxes. Let's say my monthly expenses are 5k a month. I decide that in the event I lose my job, I will give myself roughly 8 months to find a new job. So for this to work I will save 8 months worth of my expenses. 5000 * 8 = 40K. This is now in my savings, the rest I will invest in whatever I want (BTC for you I guess).

Now, what happens if I lose my job in the short term, like in 5 years? Well... I can sustain myself because of my savings. Even if I'm losing money, I have that money readily available in the short term for emergencies.

Now let's assume I invested everything into BTC and have nothing in my savings. Let's say at the start BTC was on fire but unfortunately at the time I lost my job it's -80%. Sure it will come back at some point, but this might take a long time. And right now, I'm screwed because I can't afford to live because my money has lost the majority of its value.

I've been looking at Casa's wallet solutions (more info here: [https://docs.keys.casa/wealth-security-protocol/](https://docs.keys.casa/wealth-security-protocol/)) which offers a sliding scale of protection (there's a free level, but then you step into monthly fees) - and I think it makes a lot of sense for people who have substantial holdings or are trying to be sure their estate can access it.

If I may add something closely related, about emails for registration etc:

\- *For registering for important online accounts (e.g. your exchange etc)*: use an email alias rather than your login email address, an alias that does not include your name but just random letters and number. I would recommend ProtonMail which is among the best email provider for privacy and give you a few free aliases.

\- *For newsletters or unimportant websites:* use anonymous email forwarding such as AnonDaddy. You should a different email address for each newsletter or accounts. (However, note that these serives could stop functionning one day and you might lose access to the account so make sure these are not important accounts.)

By doing this, if one of the website is hacked and the data leaked (e.g. Ledger, but it will happen again and again), then the hacker don;t have your main login email address and also don't have your name (assuming they only have your email address). Also, by using one email address per account/newsletter, you can track which website is leaking your data and report it if needed.

Can't recommend enough switching to a password manager (I use KeepassXC), it takes a bit of time to set up (log in to all your accounts to create new strong passwords etc) but once it's done it's so much peace of mind and there is no more wondering what passwords you've used for which website etc. Just make sure you follow the best pratcices (never reuse password, random characters, 20+ characters etc), easily found on the web. 2FA Authy is also great, I need to try Yubikey one day though."

Gold is extremely expensive and slow to transport securely, especially large amounts.

Gold can be confiscated. Gold has already been confiscated by the US government.

Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you, then take any gold you were transporting.

Tungsten's density is very close to that of gold. There are now gold-coated tungsten bars in circulation. It requires special equipment and know-how to detect gold-coated tungsten.

Bitcoin is inexpensive to transport, and compared to gold, transporting Bitcoin is 'instantaneous'.

Bitcoin weighs nothing and takes up little, if any space.

Bitcoin cannot be detected and can pass right through any border or airport.

Bitcoin won't stop refugees from walking long distances, nor from swimming across rivers.

Bitcoin cannot be confiscated. Robbers, pirates, corrupt cops, soldiers, etc. won't know you own any (unless you tell them), and they cannot merely kill you and take your Bitcoin.

If the supply is fixed the value is only controlled by demand which is too volatile for business transactions, so it is really more of an investment vehicle than a currency."

In Electrum versions before 3.3.3, this error is arbitrary text, and what’s worse, it is HTML/rich text (as that is the Qt default). So the server you are connected to can try to trick you by telling you to install malware (disguised as an update). You should update Electrum from the official website so that servers can no longer do this to you. If you see these messages/popups, just make sure you don’t follow them and that you don’t install what they tell you to install. The messages are just messages, they cannot hurt you by themselves."

>
[...]the users have more control over who has power with consensus and how decentralized the network is. Also note that delegation of voting weight does not mean staking of any funds - the account delegating can still spend all their available funds at any time without restrictions. This is a key advantage to the design of Open Representative Voting (ORV). With no direct monetary incentive for nodes, this removes emergent centralization forces for longer-term trending toward decentralization of the network


So, for a 51% attack you have to control 51% of the coins. As ORV consensus gets more decentralised over time by design it is getting increasingly difficult to achieve a 51% attack. Even if a malicious attacked would try to do it, trying to acquire that amount of control will crush that incentive simply by the cost of it and making its own ""bags"" worthless.

For BTC it is enough to control most of Hash Power. With BTC, Hash Power exceeds 70% in a single country, China. Chinese mining pools today control the safety of the BTC network.

You can dive deeper into that matter if you are interested. [The docs list all the potential attack vectors and their counter measures.](https://docs.nano.org/protocol-design/attack-vectors/). Yes it's the Nano docs but I suppose you figured out I was talking about that one :)

Oh and, about that virus. It's not possible to gaing control of all the coins through a virus. Also Nano has had a [third party code check by redsec](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/nano-protocol-security-audit-summary-and-full-report-48760be8ab3d) and they described it as the most secure cryptocurrency they have tested."

With regular CPU's there will be bigger players and smaller players but we are not on the mercy of ASIC manufacturers.

ASIC hardware comes with very short and limited warranty, taxes to import it from China are astronomical and fees for delivering it as well. Add to this the fact that they are very faulty and after couple months of mining they are bricked with newer hardware.

I mean, in the end what's better - A PoW that works on EVERY PC on the planet or a PoW that works ONLY on a specialized hardware that's not good for anything else.

One of the ASIC company manager/representative (don't remember the name, some Chinese woman) was so desperate that she made a long fake claim how RandomX will not stop them in the comment section of RandomX if I remember good, so we should go the ASIC route because there's no point of fighting them.

Claims were quickly dismissed by our experts.

Suppose you flipped a penny 256 times and recorded a 1 for heads and a 0 for tails:  0010111010010001101110....

There's no realistic chance that anybody else will ever come up with *exactly* your number.  24 words are lot easier to write down correctly than 256 bits.  Easier to remember, too.  So, wallets convert your seed number to a ""seed *phrase""* for you.

Put your seed phrase into a modern wallet.  The first thing, the wallet will convert the phrase into a 256-bit ""number"".  From that seed number, the wallet can derive all the private keys anybody could ever need.  From each private key, a receive address is derived.  The same seed number always generates the exact same private key sequence.  

*Using such a wallet, you back up all of your private keys by merely storing your seed phrase.*

*With early wallets, you had to be sure to back up a (potentially long) list of private keys.  Whenever you created a new key (say, by asking for a new receive address), you had to back your wallet up, again.*

If your wallet is on your phone or a ""PC"" connected to the Internet, you could find yourself vulnerable to hacking attacks.  So, hardware wallets were invented and can be used as ""cold storage"" -- that is, by not being connected to the Internet, they're relatively safe from hackers.

Many people have a ""hot"" wallet on their phone/PC with just a little ""spending money"" in it, and then they'll have a hardware wallet with long term savings, say, for retirement."

I ask, because you can buy a prepaid gift card on P2P exchanges, but the problem is after you release your escrowed BTC, the buyer could then spend the funds on your card (or the card gets identified by the issuer as being stolen / invalid).   So the workaround is to spend the prepaid card when you receive the code, then release the bitcoin once you've gotten whatever you were buying with it.

Are you living in 2015? 😂 I've heard people making that ""argument"" for half a decade now at the very least. Didn't work then and it doesn't work now.

Higher mining fees are good. It allows for stability and security. The better the mining fees the more mining participants. 

The valid arguments against high mining fees have mostly all been resolved with lightning Network. I can remember years ago that every naysayer was saying that lightning would never work that we wouldn't be able to send large amounts etc. Now we have multipath routing capable of sending large sums for extremely cheap (a couple satoshi's), and a stable lightning network with millions of dollars of value active.

If mining fees get higher then people will still be able to send large sums on the base layer. If you need to send $10,000 and it ends up costing you $5 instead of $0.50 I don't know about you but I would still be okay with that. That's a 10-30x increase from today's cost (I put a variable because you can always just wait 10 blocks and send it for a fraction of the cost).

The entire point of Bitcoin structure is to have built-in known inflation schedules (The having) that allows long periods of adjustment phases to work through the various economic factors. If you understand how the system works then you will understand how this will play out -

Either Bitcoin will keep rising in a linear fashion and the price will offset the mining losses due to the having, which has been happening and is demonstrated by all time hash rate. Other considerations are the increase of mining technology and reduction of costs, allowing for similar or increased hash rate even with reduced cost. This is done through manufacturing progress as well as energy arbitrage (geolocating to renewable energy sources like hydroelectric which a lot of large mining operations have done).

Or Bitcoin will not keep moving forward in a linear fashion and security will be reduced. Right now Bitcoin could lose more than half of its security and probably still be safe. You can think of it like the United States military. The USA spends 10 times as much as the next biggest spender on its military. It could certainly cut a large portion of its spending and still be just as safe.

Both situations allow for a stable and functioning network, which is part of its value proposition. To be a immutable decentralized ledger."

Profit, and individualism. Not some grand conspiracy theory, but whatever is most profitable to individuals in influential positions at any given moment. Each participant in the larger machine individually does whatever they can to accrue wealth for themselves and their families - most often using that influential position to do so. The problems occur when this mentality becomes so common that it transcends individuals, as it creates a spiral of mutual backscratching that demands greater and greater levels of wealth exploitation to create enough kickbacks to satisfy everyone involved.

Doing so in other countries is preferable, as it means that US nationals won't directly feel the effects of corruption as much - meaning that lawmakers on the take are more likely to be re-elected to the position that sustains their income and lifestyle. If it crosses over with the government's official foreign policy agenda, even better.

The exchange already KYCs customers so if they are withdrawing to their own address in their own non-custodial wallet they would record that as ""mine, already my KYC"". And then nothing can stop them from using it in smart contracts or sending to anyone they choose. Or is there some other part which makes each user have to report their own personal activity? It seems like the main downside is reducing functionality of custodial wallets.

As a non-American I'm not immediately personally concerned but I have an interest in that often what the US does other countries will copycat, and generally I oppose any govt self-declared right to restrict and control people.

And there’s nowhere to go to keep value. 

Now why are assets increasing but not CPI? That’s because the free money has mostly been given to high net worth people and corporations. But most people think it can’t stop there. Helicopter money (stimulus to everyday people) is going to continue and that will directly affect CPI. Soon CPI will start increasing like assets have over the last decade."

I understand that people are inspired by the path that BTC has taken, but it's really important to keep the facts straight, otherwise everyone just ends up looking like a bunch of lunatics spewing unreasonable arguments.If you look at the history of BTC, if you bought 3 months ago, now or 3 months from now, it doesn't really matter because, as you said, in the **long run** it makes little to no difference. We agree on that. But that doesn't mean it won't dip. Creating FOMO to have someone buy at a ATH just to sell at the first sign of a dip (which many people did before) is also not good for BTC. I hope you understand where I'm trying to go with this."

If yes, you should use an airgapped, permanently offline PC to decrypt the private key. You can transfer the ZIP file of bitaddress.org using a USB-thumb drive.

Once you have the decrypted private key, you can create an unsigned transaction from the address on an online machine, copy the unsigned transaction with a usb drive to the airgapped machine, sign it, copy it back to the online machine and then broadcast it. This can be done with for example, electrum (https://electrum.org is the only legit place to obtain Electrum form. Assume all other sources are malware).

To get an idea of how this works, you can watch these videos of how cold storage using Electrum works. I also recommend trying everything out with a new paper wallet that you created the same way with a very small amount of BTC loaded on it.

First and foremost, WSB, for years, has been anti crypto and especially anti bitcoin. Any mention of the word results in a ban of your post, repeatedly and you are permanently banned from the sub. Go ahead and do a search for Bitcoin on WSB and see what comes up. 

Their userbase, with their bro/retard/autism culture is not at all aligned with ours. My biggest fears is the invade and/or brigade our sub and ruin the beautify thing we have had for close to a decade. 

We are in Bitcoin because we believe in the technology, it's future and potential, the power of decentralized finance, and are not here just to pump and dump our way to a quick buck. Our two cultures could not be more different.

I have already started to see it happening, and I hope we can find a way to nip it in the bud. You are already seeing those posts that you can just tell is from a WSB'r. They BANNED any mention of Bitcoin. Their logic was BTC is not relevant. Well neither is their bullshit, let's stay true to our culture. Any true bitcoiner would upvote this post, but I fear it gets downvoted just because of the invasion. 

I hope this all comes to pass, and hope that this trend of pump and dump does not alter bitcoins trajectory. We are going to the moon and staying their, WSB moonshots run out of fuel and come crashing down.

and in the end, people who did NOT go to hospitals, were more likely to survive, I would feel like shit as well. no offense.

oh, you did not work all year to compare dozens of treatments. the reality is you guys have NO fucking clue about health since the dawn of modern medicine. it is all a scam and after this you will lose all your jobs. either that or we go full medical totalitarianism with forced vaccinations of untested drugs etc.

there is NO new disease. you have NO proof of any of your claims. the PCR-test the whole world (except china) relies on for testing, has been proven to be fraudulent, yet you still deduct conclusions off it. you are a bunch of glorified mumbo-jumbo scam artists who think they can do real magic. and if you go on to administer an untested mRNA vaccine you will be full of sin for the rest of your lives.

oh, so you don't want me to spout actual arguments? would you rather censor me? afraid after this you might lose your job for like forever? if there are sane reasonable people around here, don't you agree they would love to hear all sides of all arguments? I can back up every single claim I make with top notch experts, lawyers and real scientists. you must be unaware that 95 to 99% of experts have been censored, and are continually being censored by BIG TECH who is in on this, have you? do you know how many reasonable channels have disappeared throughout all of this? do you even care? everyone just wanted to save lives, but you are on the side that seems to need censorship to save lives, doesn't really compute, does it? are you aware that in most countries it has been made law for media outlets to not have medical issues surrounding the c-thing discussed online? like they get fined if they allow mere discussion, does this sound totalitarian or are you a narrow minded one-trick-pony? or maybe you believe censorship by large corporations is necessary to save us from misinformation which ""might"" cost lives, but then I need to ask you, since when do big corporations give a f. about human lives?? hello?

don't get so worked up, I know it sucks to have wasted one year of work. but some people waste a whole life having kids with the wrong woman, or doing a shitty job with no perspective. just allow the thought that this whole thing was planned since decades, most institutions are in on it, and the aim of this is a mixture of population control and population reduction, with a side dish of transhumanist utopianism . if you think this is all looney tooney, read the most recent book from the big mastermind of all of this: klaus schwab. I mean these guys are not even hiding their agendas, and you have just played along cause you were, like many, victims of a globally orchestrated mass hysteria with all its negative side-effects.

but look, I can shut up and let everyone try the vaccine, that is likely to kill you once the wild version of any related harmless virus hits (cytokine storm incoming) but THEN I don't want to hear ANY complaints from you, who were shooting cannons at flies.

I know how you feel, and I know you are sick of this disease, but you  really don't know whether there is an actual new disease around, or whether you collectively have been a victim of your own panic & anxiety, in combination with panic & anxiety from the ones initially flooding your premises. mass hysteria is a bitch. it's a known phenomenon and usually it takes more victims than warranted for by the threat that caused mass hysteria in the first place. I know more people who died from suicide since march, than I know people who allegedly died from this disease. the only c victim I ever heard of had these facts surrcounding his story:

* age: 79
* 2 preconditions, heavy smoker, heavy drinker, workaholic, his niece told me ""he would never rest all day""
* got a new kind of multi-flu shot in january, niece told me ""he was never ill but this year he felt a little weak
* died from a flu or whatever, tested positive for c by a test that can detect whatever the lab geeks decide, do some research on the inventor of the PCR test.

so is it possible you all overreacted?

oh and btw, we all know the psyche has way more influence over whether an infection takes place or not, more than the ""agent"" (virus, bacteria) itself. don't you agree? modern medicine is a scam, and this whole thing will be the nail in its coffin. nobody will ever trust you guys anymore. ever. unless of course you start speaking out against the pharmaceutical complex, that is as fraudulent and dangerous as the military industrial complex, the financial fiat money complex, and the corruption in politics in general. but we know you won't, you are sucking on their tit, aren't you? never bite the hand that feeds you, right?

This is part of your issue. This company is infamous in this space for their deceptiveness and also their refusal to adopt to Bitcoin's new technologies like SegWit which would have helped you save about 50% on fees.

Stay away from bitcoin.com, they are scammy, at some point they even attempted to sell an altcoin under the name ""Bitcoin""... fooling many new comers in the process, they almost got sued for it by hundreds of users.

If you have a seed for your bitcoin\.com wallet, you should be able to restore it in a proper Bitcoin wallet, like Electrum or BlueWallet, and set your own fees. If there is a transaction for your address that is ""pending"" on Bitcoin's network (not included in a block yet and still in Bitcoin nodes' mempool), it will also be displayed in those wallets. If there's none, you'll be able to create a new one with appropriate fees."
117341,go2r1z6,t3_lnwocm,1613787141.0,lnwocm,Bitcoin,6,False,False,"*copypasting myself from another thread:*  

It's not ""slow"" because it uses ""old tech"". It's slow because this is a necessary trade off for security, stability and verifiability, which no other coin has solved yet. It's trivially easy to code a 1 second block time, instead of 10 minutes, but this destroys the decentralization/stability of the network, f.ex.   

Usually, any ""improvement"" requires a trade off somewhere. On a very basic, simplified level it's like a trilemma where you have to pick two: secure - fast - cheap. If you want it fast and cheap, it won't be secure (the fastest and cheapest network is a fiat payment network like SWIFT). If you want it secure and fast, it won't be cheap. And secure and cheap won't be fast.  

This is very simplified and hence not a very correct description, but hopefully close enough to reality to explain my point.  

Add ""easy verifiability"" and ""hardcapped supply"" into the mix, and no coin will come close to what bitcoin has to offer. If this offer has any value to you is up to you, but if you want those properties, you won't be able to find them anywhere else currently.

If you are looking to Buy bitcoin with fiat money, then the methods available will differ based on a few factors:

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?


Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method:

- https://exchangewar.info <-- Filter box for currency (e.g., EUR) or payment method (e.g., VISA)


First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**, requires browser extension], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less, not available in U.S.], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Switchere](https://switchere.com), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama [KYC]). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/locations)) <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations <-- Cashier (cash), ATM (cash or debit card), Kiosk (debit card), and from any 7-Eleven, CVS, & Rite Aid -- [20,000 locations in the U.S.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitcoin-on-every-block-use-cash-to-purchase-bitcoin-with-libertyx-at-20-000-retail-locations-including-major-convenience-store-and-pharmacy-chains-301081111.html)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option:

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover), [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, r/GiftCardExchange, and r/GCTrading).


You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all
the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household
wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With
20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.](https://www.metzdowd.com/pipermail/cryptography/2009-January/015004.html)

If Paypal is not lending out BTC at interest, I don't seen any upside to not having BTC.  Actually if BTC continues to appreciate and they have less then they claim every time someone either converts BTC back to fiat or buys merchandise with BTC that appreciated they take a hit if they don't have the BTC which appreciated to back things up.  

2) As BTC transactions are irreversible, Paypal is potentially stuck in a bad place if they allow transfer off their platform. I.e if the BTC arrives before the merchandise one could transfer the BTC off Paypal, and claim they weren't paid.  Keep the BTC, keep the merchandise and the BTC can't be clawed back.  Paypal could ban the vendor but meanwhile takes a hit to its reputation and bottom line if it reimburses the buyer.

If Paypal, or for that matter Greyscale, begins lending out ""BTC "" that would be worrisome, but unless there is some shell game I am missing, I don't see how it helps them to not have the BTC they claim they have."

Aside from all the benefits, BTC is a clear threat to the existing and established fiat system, so I'm sure there's a chance an entity would rather it disappeared and then they could create their own which obviously they'd have control of.

Why not just pay fiat for the shirt? Because they're both morons?

Don't be a moron

You can't send Bitcoin from your own wallet to paypal; neither can you send Bitcoin from paypal to your own wallet -- thus, paypal only offers ""fake Bitcoin"" for fools.

Real Bitcoin cannot be confiscated, when stored properly in your own wallet. Paypal's fake Bitcoins could be confiscated at the discretion of idiot politicians like Steve Mnuchin and Chuck Shumer.

Real Bitcoin can be tracked, but that's difficult and iffy for the trackers, and not difficult to thwart if you want to. Besides, Schnorr signatures and Taproot have been added to the base code, and this will enable even better privacy. With paypal's fake Bitcoins, paypal is going to track every transaction, combine it with every fiat transaction you've made (w/ their service), use it against you, sell it to people who will use it against you, and hand it over to the government, not so the government can help you and protect you...

With real Bitcoins, I can send money to friends in places like Lebanon, Venezuela, and Iran. Try that with paypal, using fiat or fake Bitcoins. I dare you.

Mixing Bitcoins and paypal is just stupid. If you disagree, it's because you don't understand Bitcoin and the problems in the current fiat banking system."

Couple things to keep in mind:

1. Use each address only once (generate a new address each time you want to receive a payment)
2. Test with a small amount first when sending money to ensure it works and you have the right address

But you can easily see how much money you will make if you take the amount of bitcoin you have (around .40 or something if you’re buying 15k around now) and multiply by the price of bitcoin. So if it hit 1 mil per coin you would make 400,000 dollars. If it hit 500k per coin, you’d make 200,000 dollars. But what really matters is that you’re putting your money in a currency that is getting more scarce and more valuable, instead of fiat money that theyre printing more and more of, making it less valuable. So it doesnt matter how much the investment is growing, because it is going to be growing more as btc than if you left it as USD. Just dont freak out and sell it if/when the market drops."

681669,gdmm5gx,t3_k0tzxu,1606365469.0,k0tzxu,Bitcoin,1,False,False,"1. Bitcoin will only exist until the US Congress allows it. As soon as bitcoin becomes a threat to US sanctions, they will ban it and with the US out of the equation, you can kiss all American allies goodbye too. That means with US out you got Europe out, Japan, South Korea and pretty much all the relevant countries with money invested in it. You might think the government cannot ban bitcoin but a global ban on exchanges will push bitcoin back into the shadows. Peer to peer exchanges have never been a great method. Imagine going to an ally to exchange your 1 BTC for cash? Yeah, absolute nightmare. Might have better luck selling contraband, drugs and illegal guns.
2. Bitcoin only has a very limited number of transactions per second. Not only that but development has been slow and incredibly slow. Bitcoin scalability is way more limited than that of credit cards. As a matter of fact, I would argue it is quite simple to send money through Zelle, Venmo, Paypal but sending money through bitcoin requires a complicated process that may take days while you clear certain hurdles like setting a wallet, acquiring currency, properly transferring to the intended recipient. You already have global alternatives with very little effort to send money across the globe. 
3. Bitcoin has never been simple to use. It has no way to acquire it except buying or mining it. There is no jobs that pay in bitcoin and only a small number of niche stores that sell items for bitcoin. On top of that it is not simple to exchange as fiat. You can lose your private keys and with that all your money. Acquiring crypto requires setting up a complicated wallet as opposed to just handing in a piece of paper.
4. Even in countries where currency is slipping out of control only a small number of people mess with bitcoin. Countries like Argentina, Zimbabwe, Lebanon have multiple currency crises yet the people don't massively adopt bitcoin as a currency. In its current state crypto is not ready to become a viable alternative to fiat. In the future this may change but today November 25, 2020 this is not true. If you ever look at the map of crypto users it is centered in the developed world. That means that the only people buying crypto are speculators in developed countries. The heat maps are centered in US, Germany, Japan, South Korea etc.

 if the standalone value of bitcoin is changed by lower circulation, how is it calculated for the accounts that are dormant? Do you not do any calculation in which can bitcoin has no inflation/deflation and essentially dies when there are so few coins nothing can be transacted. Or do you take those dormant accounts into consideration and start to divide into infinity?

In full adoption everyone would agree on the second point. Then what happens if dormant accounts come back in use? Well the next calculation would see this and take their wallet into account which lowers the value of bitcoin. 

Then say a bank savvy enough buys X amount of bitcoin doesn’t matter how much but let’s say it’s a large amount. They wait until that wallet/s is taken out of valuation sending bitcoin up until the next calculation. Then between calculations they spend all the bitcoin in the wallet/s (price doesn’t go down immediately because it’s full adoption and they don’t know it’s being spent until the next calculation). 

The next time that calculation is done bitcoins value for goods and services plummets making everyone who transacted with that bank wallet between calculations out of pocket."

When I saw the motley crew of ex-cons and cons around that coin I never touched it with a ten foot pole, not even for a 5 minute day trade.  It was also clear, people brighter than them had serious reservations about a block size increase while Ver (the ex-con for selling explosives on the internet, hahaha) flipping off an interviewer after bragging about his wealth made it that much more clear.  I am honestly surprised they have done as well as they have thus far, but BCH is what 10 and BSV 20 in market cap, I thought they both would have been out of the top 50 by now.  But soon, having added nothing of technical merit but only vitriol to the space they'll drop off the top 100 market cap list taking their rightful place behind Bitcoin Gold and the like, before being delisted everywhere.  I suspect Ver, Wright, Ayre et al may likely cling to their dreams of owning the world long enough to go broke, avoiding BTC with what little they have left.

I wouldn't expect any less from the news that one of the most celebrated innovators of modern times directly purchased bitcoin with tesla money causing the price to shoot from ~39k to ~43k. The market is now pricing in multiple other s&p500 companies to follow the lead. Market cap gained about $80b and is now $1 trillion+. At this point nothing elon says can fluctuate the price besides real action of buying or selling more. The price movements you see right now can be literally anything, especially for example now knowing that blackrock is trading bitcoin.

Doge has a market cap of like $7b. Literal child's play for his following. Bitcoin can't be moved as easily.

When using a single bip38 key/address, and you send a fraction, the remaining bitcoins are stored on another address that the wallet program needs to generate, and NOT on the existing bip38 key.

Sidechains are not viable scalability improvements.

* The reason why you can't scale Bitcoin on the base layer is because blockchains are very resource-intensive: making them larger just increases the validation requirements on everyone.
* Knowing the above, your proposal (sidechains) makes ***more*** blockchains for even more resource usage?  WTF.
* If the sidechains have independent proof-of-work, then that just splits available mining energy, making the mainchain and all sidechains have individually reduced security.
* If the sidechains are merge-mined, then that is just a block size capacity increase by another name (miners have to validate the mainchain *and* the sidechain, increasing latency whenever a competitor successfully merge-mines a new mainblock+sideblock: it's precisely this latency increase which we want to avoid that is why we don't want to increase block sizes yet).  If you're going to go that way, just do a block size increase instead of adding a lot of crap on top that ends up being equivalent to a block size increase.

Sidechains are a viable way of adding new features (e.g. confidential transactions and confidential assets on Liquid), they are not a viable way of adding scale.

In order to scale, you need something that is very different from blockchains, which **cannot** scale.  That's why Lightning is a viable scaling solution, sidechains are not."

That does not cause you to have a taxable event, since you did not sell or spend your bitcoin.

I cannot help but think that all our TA is for naught with such powerful macro fundamental issues swirling.

* global monetary policy is rapidly showing itself to be exhausted and largely ineffective
* a trickle of public companies are adopting it in their treasuries and showing profit from it.
* Institutional money is no longer poopooing Bitcoin - probably recognizing that it is now a net negative for them to continue to do so.
* Chatter about CBDC's has dramatically accelerated
* Ever larger players are wading in (Paypal)
* US election is upon us and neither party can really fix the structural problems that the traditional financial system have caused. Bitcoin represents a genuine alternative.
* Statistically there is no asset in the world that even comes close to BTC's performance in 2020, making it the subject of attention in general (ala 2017)
* The ""blockchain not bitcoin"" narrative is dead.
* And the elephant in the room: IMF emphatically stating that a new Bretton Woods moment is upon us. The BIS back this up the next day with actions. The significance of this cannot be overstated! This is the warning shots for us to maneuver into position for the post reset world order, whatever that may end up being,
* and lots more...

We will only know the significance of these events in the rear view mirror. One thing is for sure and that is this round of FOMO will be one for the record books, and the ROMO (Regret of Missing out) will be particularly bitter for the ludites!"

A good start is not to look at wealthy people but people who became wealthy by their own efforts. 

> I imagine understanding finance is like understanding tech.

It's actually quite different. Tech is ultimately about problem solving and, depending on how deep you go, also abstract thinking. 

Finance certainly works with numbers and has some abstraction but, more than anything else, it's about people and their behavior. That makes a lot of things different. For one, there's very rarely any one correct model. 

But that is what gives you the opportunities. If there was a single correct understanding of finance, it would have been known long ago and by everyone and the prices of bitcoin (or anything else) would reflect their ""correct"" value precisely and there would be no way to make money by speculating. 

So it's the human aspect, the messy, unpredictable nature of society, that makes it possible to position yourself so that you win. You don't need to figure everything out correctly. You just need to be ahead of the crowd."

This has already failed.

>That's like saying there's no second or third or fourth generation cellular service protocols (3G, 4G, 5G...)

The advancement of cellular networks is largely due to infrastructure and materials but the base concepts haven't changed. 4G and 5G use the same underlying protocol but just switch the wavelength of the electromagnetic signal to increase the amount of data shared per second.

>A blockchain can have an extremely simple data structure like Bitcoin, or a more complex data structure. ""Next-Generation"" blockchains

I hardly see complexity at the base layer as something good. JS engines on web browsers don't operate on TCP/ICP level.

An example is the X server (a display server protocol) . The codebase is so convoluted it was practically impossible to make a complete overhaul so the developers ditched the project and made a completely different leaner and simpler display server protocol called Wayland.

>I am a huge proponent of software having a **core** library that only does what is necessary, and building layers, APIs, and other programs on top of it,

Is it even the case for Bitcoin? Lightning isn't even software nor is Bitcoin and there's no central entity to speak of so there will always be different implementations of the protocol but I've yet to experience a problem because the receiving node used different implementations. As long as people just agreed to standards it's fine.

>It doesn't add any **features** to Bitcoin, it just adds a layer of abstraction

Abstraction is a massive features with concrete advantages. That's why we use the web and operating systems. Abstraction makes the implementation of other layers and features much easier.

>you're using are within the same network

What? There's another lightning network?

>that they release the funds to the blockchain in a timely manner

Funds don't even need to be released from channels. You can indefinitely transact only with other Lightning node.

>Even if I used Lightning, someone has to pay the piper eventually

Lightning works through payment routing. Anyone with a node can route transactions. There's also no major cost to route a transaction. It's incredibly easy so the fees will never reach the level on chain."

One needs to believe that there is a use case for Crtpto before being able to claim that the BTC will have value in the longer run. These are the 2 cases : 1) A store of value 2) Use as a currency.

Case 1:  Those folks who believe that BTC (and other coins- u decide which is a sham or not) will not be debased like fiat currency due to inflation (read about Hyper infltion in Germany to learn about what the Central Bank can cause by printing Money)  will see it as a ""store of value"" Many folks believe that...I do as well. 

BTC is limited in supply and there is no central bank that is positioned to play with the ""Money Supply"" Now there is an issue around Crypto Currency creation (specifically lending BTC against collateral on a levered basis) but the fact is that no one can create more coins. Just because you put up 1BTC as collateral and borrow 2BTC doesnt mean that more BTC is created- the 2 you borrow are already in existance. This is unlike CB (Central Bank) money creation, who CAN print money. 

OK so the other part of the Store of Value arguement is that BTC has been sufficiently well established and acceptad as such and evry day we get proof that this is the case (SQ/Visa/Visa/Elon/City of Miami etc etc)

&#x200B;

Case 2:  We said above that BTC is widely accepted and gaining acceptace quickly by larger institutions as well as retail owners. That is a gating issue that has been crossed. If you can use your visa card to pay with BTC and you can send BTC to a vendor in a different company thru the Cash App as an example that is proof.  

Next is SPEED of payment. This is the tricky one. YES BTC moves faster than Gold or even Fiat currencies in large size. It does not move as fast as cash in smaller day to day transactions.

A)  the volatility of the BTC versus the USD (name the currency) is an issue IF we do not have economies that accept BTC as its own currency and not as adjust by FX changes. 

B) The 5 or 10 minutes it takes to add a transaction to the chain is the next gating issue. I am NOT going to wait 10 minutes for an ice cream and pay in BTC when i can give the store a buck and walk out before the scoops melt. This is a real issue BUT IT WILL BE SOLVED. Proof of Work can be fixed today with greater payments and Second Layer fixed like the Lightning Network are elagant ways arouns this problem.  We are,howevre, not there yet.

&#x200B;

All of the above is to say:  Store of Value in Crypto has been pretty much establisehed and Use as Currency is on ly a matter of time."

Think your heirs will find it?). Self-custody of keys is not trivial to do while still ensuring your heirs receive your coins and ensuring the heirs don't have a chance to take them before you die. Generally, for them to receive it after you die in a self-custody situation means they have to be able to get to the keys after you die. Also, if you want to split the coins between multiple heirs, that's another challenge with self-custody. Many choices that allow heirs to get to the keys after you die allow them access to the keys before you die. For many, such as a single parent with meaningful assets and with one or more dependent child, self-custody of keys could be a bigger risk. I wouldn't give a teenager the chance to clean out a brokerage account nor expect a younger child to successfully manage a self-storage solution until they grow up, and I wouldn't allow them to clean out my self-custody wallet while I'm alive, but I would want them to get the value whennI died, ensuring they could afford a university education.

The preference would be for more matured solutions to already exist, be vetted, proven, etc.

In the meantime, there are risks both ways. One article said it's estimated that over 2% of all Bitcoin get lost every year, including due to death."

You keep repeating this but you can't point me where that central authority is.

>So, can you just invent your own rules for generating Bitcoin and maintaining the ledger, and do whatever you want, whenever you want and still be using Bitcoin, along with everyone else doing what they want?

You'll be using your own fork but if enough people decide to use your fork, it will become Bitcoin.

If people like what they're doing or it benefit them they'll use it.

>That consensus is the authority

You do realize consensus isn't a centralized authority right?"

If you are NOT worried or afraid as you are buying something - you are probably buying it at the wrong time.  All my best trades started from a position of fear.  When it comes to markets, let's just say ""success has many fathers but failure is an orphan"".  Nobody is bullish after a stock has lost 85% of its value - i.e. Bitcoin after it fell from 20K to 3K.  And that's exactly when I bought my first one - after it was 3K and 98 out of 100 analysts all said not only was it down 85%, but it was also going lower THEY ALL SAID.  I knew the the bottom had to be in.  All bullishness was crushed from their bodies.  Their souls had left them.  The sold off their leveraged positions under 6K during the final collapse to 3K...  When they have all capitulated and it seems to be the worst trade ever - that's when you usually want to begin buying it.  It is only when the calls for a bullish reversal have ENDED that the capitulation is ripe for buying...  Counter-intruitive but true.  We are currently climbing the wall of worry. This is the point where it is above all time highs so noone wants to buy it.  But its also making new highs for at least a year or more to come - so as it goes higher it will eventually attract money that FOMO's into it - driving the price ever higher.  But no price will feel good to buy once its past double the previous all time highs.  Remember this - most of the DOUBLES are now behind us.  3K to 6K.  6K to 12K.  12K to 24K.  24K to 48K.  That's 4 doubles.  48K to 100K, 100K to 200K, 200K to 400K.  That's THREE more doubles.  Possible it does 2 or maaaaaaybe 3 of those doubles.   But we're potentially AT or PAST the half way point on number of doubles in the entire bull market cycle - until it tops next time...  Then the pullback may be 50% to 85% from there.  Hard to know - institutional money may solidify the market and get it 3 to 4 more doubles from here (instead of 2 or 3) but it is really hard to make any guarantees of that...  You have to go with your gut and know when you're beyond your risk tolerance ...  I'm in mid-trade here - looking to a 300K to 600K target as the top of cycle...  But maybe less.  That's why I'll be selling little tiny pieces off (like 5% to 10%) at various prices on each rung of that ladder to 300K and 600K"

""It will keep producing blocks forever and has absolute scarcity. ""

Yeah, so? There are HUNDREDS of other cryptocurrencies with the same properties as Bitcoin and some even have the name Bitcoin in them, so why Bitcoin itself?

It can take hours for Bitcoin to be sent to someone else. That doesn't sound like spaceship technology to me. You've practically said it yourself, you're making yourself believe it's the best when it's not. You can look at anything as a store of value, it doesn't make it a store of value.

Cryptocurrency has a great chance of being used by everyone in our future but it will not be Bitcoin, could be tied to silver or gold. Even many who developed Bitcoin know Bitcoin's reign is near over.

You're going to sort all the transactions in the mempool by their fee-per-byte values, largest to smallest.  Then you're going to add the one with the biggest fee-per-byte value first, then then next highest, then third highest, and so on until you run out of transastions in the mempool or you run out of space in your potential block.  After that, you go looking for a nonce and basically hash yourself silly until you solve the block or until somebody else solves a block.  Repeat.


So, the highest paying transactions (measured in satoshis per byte) go first.  Each transaction has its own size, measured in bytes.

When there are more transactions waiting than there is space in the next block, those transactions with ""small"" fee-per-byte values have to wait."

Inflation is theft.  

We have been told, over and over that inflation is necessary and that deflation would ruin civilization -- this is bullshit taught to ""economics"" students who blindly swallow it.  

You're going to enjoy deflation because next year just about everything will be cheaper.  

Deflation hurts debt slaves and their masters (the bankers).  Deflation helps honest, hard-working people trying to save money, for a car, a home, a vacation, or for old age.  Inflation hurts the honest, hard-working people and benefits debt slaves and their masters.  

**Part 2**.

Newly ""printed"" money is not distributed instantly, nor evenly, nor fairly.  Read about the ""Cantillon Effect"" when you get a chance.  Certain people get the new money first, and they get rich at the expense of the rest of us.  

**Part 3.**  

Money ""printing"" aside, we currently have a fractional reserve banking system where money is created when loans are taken out, but money is destroyed when loans are either repaid or go bad (and are written off).  Right now, there is a lot of debt, even relative to ""gdp"".  A lot of debt.  Much of that debt has gone bad, is going bad, or is about to go bad.  Corporate debt, government debt, mortgage debt, auto loans, credit card debt...  People can't pay.  As debts go bad, this is deflationary.  Deflation is typically followed by hyperinflation.

670257,gdwscp9,t1_gdwg0xd,1606591658.0,k2s5bx,Bitcoin,1,False,False,"Sure. First of all let's divide 2 kinds of multisigs: on blockchain level (i.e. P2SH or opcodes), and on application level (for instance written in java). 

&#x200B;

The problem with P2SH - is that transaction size depends on the amount of involved public keys (and they are not aggregated): so, if you want 3-of-5 signatures, then the script will contain 5 public keys, and 3 signatures. 

&#x200B;

As for the application level, the closest example to my approach - is musig Schnorr scheme. The schnorr scheme works as multisig but with m-of-m signatures only (5 of 5, or 3 of 3 and so on), but it's compact and aggregate the signatures to single one. 

&#x200B;

Coming back to my solution - it's not bitcoin specific, and can be reused in different blockchain implementations (at least, who works with secp256k1 curve). My key idea, is that you have a private key / other sensitive information or secret, with which you want to share with trusted peers, but you need to make sure, that they won't discover this secret, until m-of-n them will contribute their signatures to reveal this key. 

&#x200B;

Hope this was helpful. Thanks for the question."

What I believe is accurate it's that There is a move to larger company, stock type, and strategic balance sheet moves. Big money moves.  Might or might not be 'coordinated'. 

These moves are so much larger than a group of 'regular' investors that we experienced in 2017, when a whale could shake out hands for $5-10M. Grayscale bought approx a billion dollars of Bitcoin in the last week of 2020 on their own. They didn't pump and then dump on everyone though. IMO they aren't looking to dump, they have the interest of increasing the values of their invested cryptocurrencies to continue to secure investment. If they treat it like an ETF/fund/stock then up is good for them. Existing holders benefit and they continue to attract others. That's just one group in the international 24:7 community. 

If I understand your sentiment, this isn't the kind of adoption that most holders 'wanted', in that the thought was if all the 'little guys' band together we can replace big finance. But the price is reflecting big finance investment. The more I try to look to the future, I do believe adoption will follow and the under pinnings are being proven correct. But just not in a way the SN and the other contribuors may have wanted.  

Holders are happy with the price, but not 'the way'. Sadly I don't know that this can be fixed. Big money will always have an advantage, just like we've seen in ICOs, DeFi and all the other crypto offerings. Wealth creates wealth. Not fair, might not ever be fair. 😕"

If you end up with less than m keys you can go to the custodian, who broadcasts the transaction and is trusted to give (most of) the amount to you after the 1-month time window.

Not exactly the model of clear communication if your point is the one directly above, but I get you.

Network effects are undoubtedly very important, I wouldn't disagree. I want to point out though that those ""better options"" are not really better. Some might be better in very specific regards (f.ex better in privacy), but they make very fundamental trade offs (less scalable, less secure, less decentralized etc).  

So they might be better in one thing, but worse in many (if not all) others. There is no such thing as ""better bitcoin"".  

F.ex, Visa is **much** faster and more convenient than bitcoin. And yet it is not even a competitor in other regards. So sure, it's a better option than bitcoin in many usecases, but it doesn't solve the problems that bitcoin is solving, so it's not a ""better bitcoin""."

I don't know how well they get audited regarding their respect of the terms of this license, but at least if they default on their debt to their customers who gave them custody of their funds in Bitcoin will have a recourse I guess (provided that they can prove PayPal defaulted because they didn't hold sufficient reserves).

I honestly think that given Bitcoin's success it would be insane to not have large reserves for such a service, so the market does provide the right incentive to make them (i.e. we shouldn't need a license for this) so I'm still against Bitlicense, mainly because it acts as a way to only let rich institutions participate on the fiat side of the market."

If people (software actually) use proper encryption + TOR networks + VPNs for the infrastructure, sure, blocking their traffic *might* be doable by the government on a case by case basis if they laser focus on specific individuals, but it would certainly not be *trivial*.

The only thing governments can do is apply a nationwide ban on all P2P encrypted transmissions, since they can't know which contains bitcoin traffic and which doesn't, only being allowed to connect to a hand-picked whitelist of addresses. That would break the utility of the internet for that nation and put them at a severe disadvantage, not to mention the amount of backlash from small business owners.

They aren't mark-to-market so what would I care?  The cash flow the assets generate are more than enough to service the debt with a healthy margin of safety and reasonably uncorrelated, geographically and otherwise.

>If you had no debt and an asset you want fell in price, then you could open leverage to buy in. If you were already leveraged, you can't. So leverage not only amplifies wins and losses but costs opportunity as well.

...
But then you would be in the situation I am in where you are using debt and have to deal with some FIRE enthusiast on the internet telling you that what you are doing is wrong... Consider that there is also a cost to NOT using leverage as well.  I know that I have made a lot more money using leverage than I would have otherwise if I had avoided debt.  

>If inflation is going to be higher in the future and you have no debt, then your assets inflated along with it. 

I have a lot more assets than I would otherwise have because of my willingness to take on low interest debt.  Do you agree that current government policy effectively subsidizes borrowing?  That is, I get better financing terms than I otherwise would because government is subsidizing my borrowing cost?  If you concur, wouldn't you agree that not borrowing is leaving this subsidy on the table? 

>No debt is good bro. Kevin O'leary has no debt anymore, for example, and he owns more assets than most people. His assets generate so much cash that it isn't important. His assets generate more cash as inflation rises. See any successful business or the markets in general.

I'm not going to type out a huge post about how I think Kevin is a huge dumbass, but I assure you Kevin would have far more assets if he took on more debt.  Instead of comparing Kevin's assets to other people, you should compare no-debt Kevin to a hypothetical leveraged Kevin.

>So yeah, no debt is great. You can't look at it blindly like you are.

BLINDLY???  All the debt I have was acquired after plenty of due diligence to ensure the underlying asset would generate enough cash flow to cover expenses + debt service with a reasonable adjustment for risk.  My strategy got hit with a pandemic and eviction freeze right after I bought another property and before I was able to evict the bad carryover tenants, plus major unexpected repair cost from an existing property.  It would have been hard for me to imagine a harder stress test in January.  The fact that my portfolio is holding up and I haven't missed a payment shows that my debt was not acquired blindly.

Even if it weren't I do have debt forbearance options that I haven't even tapped into yet.  

Lastly, would you buy a bond in this environment?  I certainly would not.  I consider my debt strategy to have the added benefit of effectively shorting bonds.  How do I lose?  Interest rates go up?  I win.  Inflation goes up?  I win.  Nothing happens?  I win from cash flows."

It's how the tax money is spent that determines that. Taxes money given to those who provide no value to society is redistribution of wealth, tax money used to fund roads and schools is not.  
  
The only reason redistribution isn't an immediate death sentence is because there are more people coming in to start businesses when the current people leave due to being treated unfairly. That's like saying beating your wife isn't a death sentence to your marriage, because people re-marry. It's not a logical assessment.  
  
Sure, businesses can survive with slightly higher taxes. Is that a reason to tax them higher? No. I'm sure you would find a way to survive if I forced you to give me 5% of your income as well.  
  
And no, that's incorrect. There would be paved roads and schools and security without taxes. If there is a need for those things, people will voluntarily pool together to create them. That's how it was in the very beginning. People wanted to receive and send items faster, so roads and transportation was developed and paid for privately and voluntarily. There was a need and monetary incentive for building such things. People wanted better education for themselves and their children, so schools were developed and paid for privately and voluntarily. There was a need and a value it brings to society by teaching people the skills they need for a productive and sound society. People wanted better security, so neighborhood watches, defense weapons, and security systems were developed. Which brings value in having a safe place to live. To say these things would not exist without taxes is absurd. If there is a need, that need will be fulfilled.  
  
And no, there is no conclusion that redistribution is not inherently a flawed concept. Your definition of redistribution is what's flawed. Redistribution of wealth is providing money to people and things indirectly proportional to the value they bring to the people in the society.

Well that depends on how you look at it. Each new flagship is actually more expensive than the previous generation. Prices drop on products that quickly go into obsolescence.

It also seems really narrow to limit observations to smartphones. Does that behavior occur on many other areas? Of course not.

>The harm of consumers waiting for something better is obviously pretty limited based on empirical observations.

If you want empirical observations go look at the cade study of deflation in Japan back in the day. That is a much better example of what happens when deflation occurs.

Since you asked:

**Bonds**: promise of future payment, highly stable & safe.

**Equities**: buying a piece of a profit generating entity in the hope of sharing in that profit. People bought shares in the East India Company back in the day because it was generating profit and they wanted a part of it.

**Real estate**: the value of the land directly correlates to nearby human activity/resources/or basic need for somewhere to live.

**Gold**: somewhat tradition based, but still a limited resource with substantial industrial value.

**Fiat currency**: loosely tied to the value of a person's time in acquiring it, and its accepted purchasing power. Value protected by soveriegn governments. This is the closest you list to Bitcoin, and it sitll has a more pragmatic basis.

**Consumer confidence**: consumer confidence is less transferable than goodwill or whatever but again, value related to tangible wants and needs.

&#x200B;

Tell me how an infinitely replicable algorithm currency (whose value is derived **solely** from its first move advantage and society's desperation to get-rich-quick in a highly consumerist world) shares any trait with the above listed.

And yet, **again**, people/entities buying Bitcoin doesn't mean it has any actual value - they'd buy snake oil if they thought they could make money from it."

""Confessions of an economic hitman"" shet some light on this wonderful organization.

Of cause working together is a nobel and fine statement, but also the goal of such collaboration and finally the results should be carefully examined to see if it does what it is factually supposed to do.

The IMF can't be blind for the consequences the fiat system has and what the downsides are for a currency as the Dollar to have the status as world reserve currency.

The IMF can't hide behind the innocent behavior they don't know what the implications are of inflation for the working class.

And finally the fact that the IMF is very busy trying to promote their own Standard Drawing Rights as a potential follow up for the world reserve currency should be the last one to convince people to be very scared of this IMF.

Why can any organization and their members, also check BIS: Bank of International Settlement,  be above the law, and especially why would that be needed if they state they have mentioned Nobel goals?

I can only advise to actually start reading some non official stuff, not published by mentioned organization.

Most of the stuff is so incredibly disturbing you will need some time to digest the implications.

Again no better samples of why Bitcoin, being decentralized, hard limited, uncensored, etc etc, is in all ways a way better system.

I don't know how you can act like this wasn't a bubble when I could go buy a couple dozen of these broken tulips for 20 bucks today. 

>The broken bulbs was a niché market that suffered from broken trust in payment that made prices collapse. 

The reason trust in payment failed is because people were way over leveraged. Contracts to buy tulips in the future are literally just options contracts which is an inherently leveraged product. 

So, what part of my description of the tulip buble was not accurate again?"

For those that are technical....

For a bit of knowledge on email security, you can research [DKIM headers](https://help.returnpath.com/hc/en-us/articles/222438487-DKIM-signature-header-detail) that show up if you examine your email headers.  For example, the last email I got from ""Ledger Newsletter"" had the following DKIM header:

    DKIM-Signature: v=1; <clip>; s=oiyvgsf2hrwyxn7dtne7hjmhgfx33sds; d=ledger.com

I'd image that subsequent emails from ledger would have `d=ledger.com` and similar values for either `s=` or `p=`.  You may also want to check other official emails from before the breach, but be aware that key cycling once or twice a year is also normal.

- Where are you located (country)?
- How much are you looking to buy?
- What payment methods do you have available?
- How soon do you need access to the proceeds?
- Is financial privacy important?

You can purchase online using a No-KYC online store, paying by depositing cash in a bank account or through Moneygram/Western Union:

- [BitQuick QuickBuy](https://www.bitquick.co/quick-buy) [**NO-KYC** (when trx amount is under $400)]

There are physical locations where there are Bitcoin ATMs and other vending/voucher methods.  For example, in the U.S. there is:

- https://coinatmradar.com <-- Some will require Identity verification/KYC, others just a phone number (e.g., CoinFlip ATMs, when $900 or less), or nothing at all
- https://www.coinstar.com/bitcoin (with [2,200+ locations in the U.S.](https://coinme.com/locations)) <-- Identity verification/KYC
- https://libertyx.com/a/buy/locations <-- Cashier (cash), ATM (cash or debit card), Kiosk (debit card), and from any 7-Eleven, CVS, & Rite Aid -- [20,000 locations in the U.S.](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bitcoin-on-every-block-use-cash-to-purchase-bitcoin-with-libertyx-at-20-000-retail-locations-including-major-convenience-store-and-pharmacy-chains-301081111.html)
- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dabf2m <-- Some will require identify verification/KYC, but not all will.

Otherwise, an in-person cash trade or an online trade using a P2P trading exchange may possibly be your next best option. There are No-KYC payment methods: In-person cash trade, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, [cash-in-the-mail](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cc9izx), [postal money order](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/cc9izx/cash_by_mail_an_underutilized_way_to_buy_bitcoin/etlbuq1), and prepaid gift card.  There are sellers on the P2P exchanges who accept these payment methods.

*P2P Trading exchanges*

- [Person-to-person (P2P) Trading Exchanges](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dyclf8)
- https://exchangerates.pro <-- Choose country and/or Payment Method

Using gift cards, there is [CardCoins](https://www.cardcoins.co) for paying with a non-reloadable, prepaid GIFT card (VISA/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover), [Redeem](https://www.redeeem.com/gift-cards), [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io) for paying with gift cards for numerous brands, r/GiftCardExchange, and r/GCTrading). Most of these payment methods will require identity verification / KYC though.


First time buyers may like the convenience of an online store that sells bitcoin and accepts debit and/or credit card. I do not know which ones require ID verification/KYC beyond those marked as such. (e.g., [Bitsell X](https://bitsellx.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC**, requires browser extension], [CoinCorner](https://coincorner.com) [[💳](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card)] [**NO-KYC** when £900 or less, not available in U.S.], [CEX.io](https://CEX.io.com), [Coinify](https://www.coinify.com), [Paybis](https://paybis.com), [Jubiter](https://app.jubiter.com/neworder/buy), [Bittylicious](https://bittylicious.com), [BitIreland](https://bitireland.ie), [Kuna.io Money](https://money.kuna.io), [LiteBit.eu](https://www.litebit.eu/en/buy), [Switchere](https://switchere.com), [Conio.com](https://conio.com) App, [CryptoVoucher.io](https://cryptovoucher.io), [Cash App](https://cash.app/bitcoin) and CoinMama [KYC]). You can buy BTC on Cash App without ID but you won't be able to withdraw them until you are KYC verified.


Here's a useful comparison of exchanges in which you can filter on payment method. Most of these payment methods will require identity verification / KYC though.

He has virtually no power to do stupid things. He has got power for good ideas, but no power for bad ideas.

The bitcoin protocol can be thought of much in the same way as the [internet protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite), which is just an agreed design of how data is routed with a group of people - [the Internet Task Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force) \- pitching in their ideas on how it is best designed. Ideas get incorporated based on the merit of the idea and not based on the status of a person in a hierarchy, as there isn't really a hierarchy.

The phenomenon that arises in such projects is '[rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus)' and this just doesn't allow one person or even large group colluding to do stupid stuff.

Bad ideas either won't work and won't get consensus, they fork off and at worst result in a flaw, but nothing that would result in a disastrous collapse. The internet has some design flaws as well, that could have been done differently, but it hasn't resulted in people onboarding a completely different internet (fork) or the collapse of the internet protocol. The longer the protocol is around and small changes are being added to it, the more it, what Andrea A calls, 'ossifies' and this is mostly a good thing. 

The framing of your question shows that you think of the world as hierarchical, and it is correct that most of society is hierarchical. The bitcoin protocol is not, it is hornets nest of people working on the same aim with the difference that there is no queen."

Then we whip out our copies of the Constitution, turn to the back where the Bill of Rights are, and remind them:

>First Amendment                   
>  
>**Congress shall make no law**  respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free  exercise thereof; or **abridging the freedom of speech**, or of the press;  or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the  Government for a redress of grievances.

&#x200B;

And if they're still confused, we remind them that they work for us, that **they need our consent** to govern us:

### We hold these truths to be self-evident,

that all men are created equal,

that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,

that among these are

* Life,
* Liberty
* and the pursuit of Happiness.

\- - That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, **deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,**

\- - That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.

Many of these companies fiscal years are too far away for them to sit on their hands and wait so as to try and time entry to avoid disclosure to the SEC.

If you knew that apples were a dollar, but a crate was coming in 2 days and the price may be inflated, but you also knew all your friends know that and that a lot of people are coming to town, and everyone wants apples, the optimal approach is to buy now.

Probably a shit analogy but it gets my point across. We have never had institutional interest like this, and you can guarantee that many (not all, or perhaps not even most) of these companies will be wanting some exposure. And they're already getting it. The price has been above 45k now since it was its ATH. We've  never seen ATH after ATH follower by such stability.

The dips are already getting bought up institutionally.

Most fiscal years run in line with the calander year, but some rogue companies like tesla file in Feb and March. Some big companies like Oracle and Microsoft file mid year in June I think. Basically everyone knows they have till June *maybe* to load up, because after that 45k is going to look dirt cheap.

I'd be interested to know if many companies file their 10K coming up. I only know the biggest ones."

Why?

Your solution is compliant while theirs is simply not:

208672,gmwe4td,t3_lguku9,1613014657.0,lguku9,Bitcoin,1,False,False,"Correct be if I'm wrong, but I'm coming up with **US$ 15.5 billion**. Let's assume miners invest most of their revenue in eletricity and hardware. They get the block reward plus the transaction fee.

Market forces will make sure most of the revenue will be spent on electrcity (If the revenue is higher than the cost of mining, they make a profit, making it more attractive for others to join the mining business, eventually raising the difficulty, making sure they don't mine too fast.)

The block reward is currently 6.25 BTC very 10 minutes on average. At the current price of $ 44,000, that equals $ 275,000. 6 Blocks per hour, 24 hours per day, 365 days per year, this will be US$ 14.5 billion for the miners per year.

The transaction fee is volatile. [https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transaction-fees](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/transaction-fees)

Let's just assume another 60 BTC per day. That's 18,250 BTC per year. At the current price that's almost another billion.

**So at the current price and block reward, there will be roughly US$ 15.5 billion per year spent on electricity.**

Also, market forces will make sure miners will quickly locate to places with an abundance of electricity like no other industry can. So maybe bitcoin mining does not drive energy production at all, simply utilizing it more efficiently. Maybe someone else can do the math on that."
351088,gjan37z,t1_gjah4oi,1610673584.0,kxihsj,Bitcoin,2,False,False,"Another thought though is that, since the total ultimate supply is known, some amount of price-in has already been done, or is being continuously done irrespective of halvenings as more people enter the space.  After all, we know it's 21m BTC at the end of the road, there's no reason to wait until 2140 to figure out that it's going to be scarce ;)

So if the relationship is not inverse, meaning new coin rate halves but price does not double (maybe it's flat, linearly increasing, or some other non-exponential function), you'd maybe expect each halvening to rather drive out a few miners, who are competing for smaller rewards (in BTC *and* fiat).  All else, like electricity cost, being equal of course.

This is where the thought of a ""bubble"" can arise, though ""bubble"" is misleading; it's really a large price correction.  If you believe nobody is pricing in scarcity to BTC, you will believe in the exponential price increase every 4 years (halvening).   
 If everyone believes the same, no large correction in near time horizons.  If enough people don't however, there's a reckoning every so often.

I think we see the latter evidenced in the charts more than the former.  The gradual calming of each successive correction maybe implies cooler heads entering over time, more understanding of the tech and figuring out where the price should be well ahead of when it ""needs"" to be there because of the technology and costs.  Today it ""needs"" to be around $15k if I recall correctly for most miners to be breaking even, though the range is fairly wide."

Whole infrastructures are being built around crypto and the technology behind it has lots and lots of potential. Banning it would be a huge step backwards. It's not just bitcoin.

Well that's kind of an interesting question. At first I thought it depends very much on *why* everyone's enjoying bananas more, however I changed my mind. If, for example, that extra enjoyment came from people enjoying something else less at the same time, value might be pulled from that. If there's no other consequence and people simply enjoy bananas more without any other change, what it would do is change the priorities of people. So this is actually a similar situation actually. 

If said people generally bought 4 bananas per month, 4 apples per month, and 4 oranges per month, and then suddenly liked bananas a lot more, their appetites probably didn't change, so if they like bananas a lot more now, they're probably just going to do something like buy 8 bananas per month, and reduce the amount of apples and oranges they buy per month. So the wealth would come out of the market value of those other fruit. 

Now, going back to what I mentioned about value and price being different, in the above case, the prices would shift around, however the value of the apples and oranges didn't actually change - its just that the value of the bananas went up. So in a sense, whatever caused people to like bananas more did in fact cause more value to be had, creating value and therefore wealth. This would be wealth in terms of economic utility - happiness. A happier people is a wealthier people. 

So if you, for example, produced some kind of genetic technology that made people like bananas more, in effect that would create wealth/utility/happiness. But that is what would be causing it, not the bananas themselves or market price of bananas. The market price would simply be an indicator. 

If it truly happened randomly, the world would be wealthier, but its because of the increased happiness it creates. The market price itself is, to repeat, just an indicator of that. 

Bringing it back to bitcoin, we agree that the creation of bitcoin created wealth (and its continuing development continues to). I would say that the increasing market cap is simply an indicator that happens as more and more people realize the uses it has and the wealth that it created. However, the market price (just like in the bananas case) increases from the loss of market price of fiat currencies and other things bitcoin is replacing.  

> a 50 million dollar buy doesn't mean that the market cap will increase by 50 million. The reality is that it will likely increase by much more than 50 million.

Definitely. The market cap is an amplified number in comparison to the actual amount of money that has gone into it."

It doesn't buy the proverbial ""cup of coffee"", IMHO.  That was always a silly goal (but worth pursuing!).

What bitcoin *does* is provide the only method of transferring *huge* sums of money anywhere on earth securely, privately, and instantly.  Every time a guy like Paul Manafort gets caught with $165 million tied up in Russian funds, and wants a way to move that money fast, BTC is the only way to do it.  

What other option is there?  Send a guy on an airplane with a briefcase full of gold?  There's just so much risk in every other method.

Do the math. 

It's much harder to make up for a 50% loss than it is to make up for missing another 20% rise if you think long term there is a 1000% rise that will happen. 

If you lose 50% then it takes a lot of 20% rises to get that back to square one. 

If you take profits and are on the sidelines and you miss a 20% additional rise or even a 100% additional rise but think long term there will be a 1000% rise then all you did was get in a little late with your full money when volatility calmed down.  

But if you lose 50% then you still don't know when to get in but you start from way behind where you were. 

Also if you get out and think there is a 50 % change of a 50% crash then if you get back in with all your money after the crash then you can double your profits on the next rise whatever that rise will be. 

Is this correct  math wise? 

Of course this doesn't really apply for asset classes that just steadily go up 10% a year because you probably dont need to worry about short term crashes.  But with things that have surges and crashes where you are trying to guess the top of the surge then it seems to make sense.

Is the math right or wrong?"

I absolutely do run across people who can command mastery over domains of knowledge that I respect and realize greatly outstrip my own knowledge in those domains.

But I also see many people in various forms of media who drive conversations with assertions and 'data' that I know to be absolutely horseshit.

In other words, there are many people who have a talent for convincing people that they know what they are talking about.  Bravado and bullying go a long way, for instance.  It doesn't mean they know a damn thing though.  Or aren't purposefully misleading you. 

For instance, if Elon started telling you about his views on God, would who afford him as much respect there as you seemingly do for crypto?  How about art, or history, or cooking?

As far as the con man thing goes, maybe watch some Thunderfoot videos.  He has a few on Elon's ventures in digging holes, building spacecraft, etc. 

https://youtube.com/c/Thunderf00t

Let me say, Elon is big on promise, but not as big on delivery.  I recognize that Tesla has delivered on electric cars, but that was a very blue ocean for him to dip his toes into and the specifics of many of his promises leave a LOT to be desired.   And by this, I mean that electric cars existed 100+ years ago.  They just fell by the wayside and all the car 'experts' refused to entertain the idea. 

He's just a man.  Like any other man."

That could still go a bit higher, especially with the asset class becoming more institution friendly/accepted. I'm not sure if these institutions have particular rules in place like sell if the price rises a certain amount within a given time period. If that's the case, it's tougher to predict but I'm guessing that some of these institutions are buying with plans to hold so you're not seeing the same selling forces at play. I think the next couple weeks will be telling if the price acts cyclically compared to 2017-2018. 40k may have been top and I wouldn't be surprised if we see some consolidation back to the 15k range after the mania dies down. I think we'll see it get above 100k as we head into 2025 though. Hopefully we don't have any economic crises before then although I know some say that Bitcoin may perform well in that sort of crisis but it's still not a liquid asset compared to cash.

I  know that BTC fees can be surprising sometimes if you don't totally  understand how the BTC network calculates fees.

BTC  fees are determined by how busy the network is at the time. The busier the network is - the more expensive a transaction will be if you want it  delivered within a reasonable amount of time.

BTC  fees are also determined by how much information is being sent in the  transaction. The amount of information in a transaction does not depend  on the dollar amount sent, but on the number of previously received deposits.  The more inputs you have, the more expensive the transaction.

Here's a great article explaining network transaction fees:  
[https://support.exodus.io/article/68-does-exodus-have-fees-to-send-or-receive#](https://support.exodus.io/article/68-does-exodus-have-fees-to-send-or-receive#)

Of  course, you can always set your own BTC fees but a transaction sent with a lower fee will take much longer to confirm.

If you are using a wallet that supports [replace-by-fee](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Replace_by_fee) (RBF), and have it enabled before creating your send transaction, you can feel comfortable going on the lower-end of the transaction fee range. If the transaction doesn't confirm soon enough for you, you simply bump the fee using RBF.

*Wallets supporting RBF*

- https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/b8qf4c
- https://bitcoinops.org/en/compatibility/#replace-by-fee-rbf

There's also the fee bumping method known as child-pays-for-parent (CPFP). If you send a transaction and the fee was too low, you can spend the ""change"" transaction but double up the fee required. This will cause the miners to look at both transactions as a set, and the combined fees should then be high enough to get both confirmed.  CPFP also can be done if you are the recipient of the funds.

BITCOIN- will continue to iterate- and it absolutely is ‘digital gold’. 
12 years of operation and over 10% adoption- and giving rise to new industries.

View it as a store of value. Rather than currency. 

The current tech offshoots will follow the same multi-decade adoption.

The recovery phrase reinstates a wallet and its related private keys. A seed phrase will likewise reinstate a private key. But if you have the private key(s), you have control. Hence ""Not Your Keys, Not Your Coins"", no ""Not Your Recovery Phrase, Not Your Coins"".

Check out, for example,  [http://royalforkblog.github.io/2014/08/11/graphical-address-generator/](http://royalforkblog.github.io/2014/08/11/graphical-address-generator/)

Type in the seed phrase ""Satoshi Nakamoto"". That leads to the private key  A0DC65FFCA799873CBEA0AC274015B9526505DAAAED385155425F7337704883E  and the address  17ZYZASydeA1xyfNrcYcLyqghmK3eGJpHq 

Check out the address on a blockchain explorer, such as [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/17ZYZASydeA1xyfNrcYcLyqghmK3eGJpHq](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/17ZYZASydeA1xyfNrcYcLyqghmK3eGJpHq)

If there was a balance there, the private key would control it.

So the recovery phrase brings back a wallet, the wallet manages the keys, but if you have the keys, you are ready to go.

If you were to use your gains, you will pay income tax as well as another 10% penalty, when you could have just paid 15% long term capital gains.

371832,gj0z4ls,t1_gj0anl9,1610477035.0,kvrua1,Bitcoin,2,False,False,"Realistically Bitcoin is deflationary by nature. A fixed amount of it exists vs an ever increasing amount of world production that gets cheaper over time. If Bitcoin is a desirable thing to have, then it will gain value relative to other items. This ignores how lost bitcoin wallets actually mean the quantity of it decreases overtime, it doesn’t actually even stay level.

This is a problem for a currency. There’s a reason governments aim for a 1-2% inflation rate, and that’s to incentivize people to actually use their money instead of just HODLing it. When something has  increasing value, as bitcoin does, you’re incentivized instead to keep your value stored in it until you’re prepared to make a major purchase. You don’t buy gold to exchange it for potatoes later, you buy it so your net worth stays stable while you save up enough total to retire or buy a house.

All of this is to say, Bitcoin is more similar to rare materials and scare objects than it is to a currency. Bitcoin’s long term purpose makes more sense as a store of value and a way of exchanging large quantities of value than it does as a currency (if it does have a long term value. I am admittedly skeptical that Bitcoin can last long term without a more concrete purpose, but I do also admit that most of gold’s value doesn’t come from its utility so I could easily be wrong here.) A cryptocurrency designed to actually be a currency would be better created to have a basic level of inflation built into it, probably inflating by 2% yearly or something along those lines, introducing an incentive to actually use it before it’s value was diluted. The main benefit over a fiat currency of course being that the inflation rate is static and guaranteed, not held at the whims of a government, along with the standard other benefits that come from a block chain."

I know as a world reserve currency USD has more leverage to be printed over the 2% without causing 2% inflation (besides population growth and expansion).

I think people know how it's more complicated than 'inflation' but they also know systems break. Hedging is fine, because you want to be hedged before the system breaks. It's not going to let you know ahead of time. 

Science tells us about the experiment that just took place. Not what results we should expect. In the same way, they can look back and say why we didn't see inflation before, but can't state we won't see it in the future.

Do you know anyone who start a conversation like this ""did you just saw the price action of [insert big company] ?"", because the only ones I know are shills to me (not against you). So first you don't need to start a topic on that, you are happy of your gains, COOL STORY BRO, but others didn't get your gains for various reasons no need to start a frustrating conversation where someone is cucking that he made big money and not them (and again this is not against you, imagine someone shilling you bs bonds because he made a gain 20 years ago or whatever)

Second, if people are not willing to learn, it is not the teacher who can convince them. If they are not interested, no need to teach them, move on to another topic they can enjoy.

Third, if they are indeed interested in Bitcoin, you can start to inform them. What is backing Bitcoin ? Hundred thousand of peers nodes which are willing to record a transaction for you against a transaction fee to pay for security of the ledger. The money spend on Bitcoin goes to someone who sell them to you, could be anyone who accept Bitcoin or need to sell to redeem a debt or take profit.  No one control anything because the network of peers keep everything in check, even between peers themself. Only premined cryptocurrencies have indeed a central actor in control of the supply and often the protocol. Only Bitcoin has strong garantees to avoid that: anyone can be a peer, just by running a full node (and your motivation in Bitcoin would be disturbing if you don't).

Keep in mind, no need to educate them if they are not willing to learn. Accept that they must come to you first before you start to go into details. They know you are informed, that's enough, their turn now."

/u/Live_Think_Diagnosis will help you do big projects, hire you a lot of people.

/u/hardworkerincrisis is my guy. He's great! On time and can do complicated things quite well, good English, always paid in Bitcoin.

/u/toxicitybv just contacted me, also looking for work, good English (Romania).

Some others I spoke with and thought about working with are:

/u/AlexDKZ - /u/Sketchy-Art - /u/renzd

And others in the list were:

/u/___DEADP00L__ - /u/conqher - /u/kp1971 - /u/yolandart

Working with people remote can be a challenge. Design a small sample assignment. I paid $20 for everyone who did the sample of my work, something that would take me like 30 mins, but them about 2 hours (knowing English was critical for me).

Then, for the one who did it best, I gave him another project with a flat fee of $20, that would take me about an hour, any worker of mine about 2 hours. He did it great! Probably spent 6 hours on it to be honest.

Then I sent over 8 more similar projects, which he was able to complete in about 2 hours each, paid $160.

Now I streamlined the process, and he'll probably get future work done in an hour, and I'll still pay $20. The reason is keeping the contact is more important than trimming the price.

If I get 100 hours of these assignments (could happen), then that's $2,000 to him and quite a lot to me too. Being able to accept 'unlimited amounts of customer requests' is more vital than paying the lowest in wages, and as $20 / hr is presumably top pay, and he is (IMO) a top quality worker, it works for both.

That's the way I do it; **always keep a Venezuelan in your pocket**. You never know when you might need to spend one, and time in the market is better than timing the market (tut tut)."

I investigated crypto early (Feathercoin) but only got into it with Electroneum mining. I put in what I can afford to lose but am excited when I see the prices rise. We will see."

YOu won't feel as bad if the price drops after your first purchase because you'll be getting deals on the next 3.

I'm not a financial advisor and you should take whatever approach you think works best for you. The strategy I outlined above is something you can do if you want to invest more in bitcoin but are worried about the potential for a short-term dip.

For beginners, it's a great way to ""dip your toes in"" toward becoming your own bank. You can learn how to self-custody your bitcoins by purchasing a small amount and sending it to a wallet app on your phone.

And most reputable Bitcoin ATM companies WILL ask for some measure of KYC. Because like every other financial institution in the USA, Bitcoin sellers are regulated by the federal government and are required by law to collect this information.

If you're thinking about buying Bitcoins from a Bitcoin ATM, try calling their customer support line and see how responsive they are to any questions you may have. They should, at a minimum, be able to answer questions like:

* what kind of ID you need to bring?
* what are you daily limits?
* how long after my purchase will I receive my bitcoins in my wallet?
* How do you keep my information safe?
* What are your rates? If I put in X Dollars, how many bitcoins will I receive?

95756,go9hx7q,t3_lovx1d,1613939373.0,lovx1d,Bitcoin,8,False,False,"Proof of work is the most important innovation in Bitcoin and the real reason why blocks , in a blockchain, exist.

The key aspects as to why Proof of work is so important and cannot be replaced by PoS are:

1) **Fair Coin Distribution**  No scammy ICO , premine or instamine is created and miners are forced to sell most of their coins to cover the expense (mainly ASICs + electricity) which allows a fair distribution and competition in the minting process.

2) **long term incentives** With coins that have premines/instamines/ICOs the incentives are such that the creators benefit from pumping and dumping and creating more altcoins/ICOs to ""fundraise"" more rather than miners who have sunk infrastructure costs on mining a particular algo(The more we approach Moore's cliff the longer these time preferences become as we have been seeing)

3) **Decentralization of Minting** Since mining BTC is so competitive, profit margins are typically thin and thus new entrants that either use a better tool to mine (ASIC) or find cheaper sources of power(typically green due to the economics) can quickly gain market share making lasting monopolies difficult. Even if a main ASIC manufacturer appears to have a large market share we can see this quickly change due to a single malinvestment or a mistake when developing the newest ASIC. Power is a resource that comes from many sources and allows many locations around the world to remain competitive for unique reasons. 

4) **Sybil resistant** Proof of work allows miners to order transactions where there are real tangible costs to transaction selection and fake nodes cannot simply flood the ecosystem in order to attack the network

5) **Game Theory** The game theory of Bitcoin is such that it is more profitable to mine bitcoin and secure the network than attack it because any attempt at a 51% attack or reorg the chain would quickly be caught once the attack was executed and the loss in resources would be profound. https://www.crypto51.app

6) **Objective Security** - Proof of work gives us an objective and measurable degree of security where risk assessments can be made with greater precision that isn't afforded with more subjective forms of security. 

6)	**Less Regulatory Scrutiny** - One critical aspect to how securities are defined and regulated by governments(for the USA research into ""Howey Test"" but other countries have similar regulations) deals with who controls the money/investment and a common enterprise profiting from it. Because Proof of work allows anyone to become a bank that mints and secures the network that no-one can control courts have already determined that Bitcoin cannot be considered a ""security"" and thus would not fall under those regulations like other coins/ICOs that lack Proof of Work. PoW alone is not the only determining factor on defining what is and isn't a security but an important one."

Putin is a huge piece of shit. In order to keep things safe from dirtbags like him, you need to store things secretly or out of the country. A few ways of doing that:

* Protect your seed with a passphrase (that you only keep in your head) so authorities that find the seed can't use it without your passphrase.
  * Downside: this isn't very inheritable.
  * Downside: [the $5 wrench attack](https://xkcd.com/538/) - which is not quite as funny when you live in [The Motherland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0yigVFFwqM&ab_channel=SpessSigiswulf).
* Store your seed in a safe in a location that isn't connected to your identity. This might be a private safe somewhere that you're sure doesn't send information to the government or maybe a trusted friend. 
  * Downside: whoever you're storing it with could gain access to your seed. This means you probably want to use a passphrase as mentioned above, or multisig as mentioned below.
* Hide your seed somewhere only you know (or only you and a couple trusted friends/family members).
  * Downside: Someone could see you hiding it.
  * Downside: This is basically security by obscurity and shouldn't be solely relied upon.
* Keep your seed out of the country. This way your country's government can't access it. Of course, the other country's government might. An example of this is using [Casa Keys](https://keys.casa/) where they keep one or two of the keys to a multisig wallet.
  * Downside: someone else has (one of your) seeds.
  * Downside: depending on how you do it, it might be difficult to access (Casa however is an online thing that's easy to access).
* Multisig is definitely the most secure option. You can use multiple methods to secure multiple seeds that eliminate any central point of failure. For example, you could create 3 seeds and 2 passphrases to create 5 different wallets (seed A, seed B, seed C, seed A + passphrase, seed B + passphrase), and store the seeds in 3 different locations. You could use these seeds to create a 3 of 5 wallet, which can protect you against even the $5 wrench attack.
  * Downside: Its more complicated.
  * Downside: Its harder to use (to send money when you need to, and to check up on your seeds). 

For someone who was/is in Alexei Navalny's position, this might be a good way to store your coins:

* Create a 3-of-5 multisig wallet with 2 hardware wallets, 2 passphrases, and 1 seed stored and maintained by a trusted outside of the country (seed 1 + passphrase 1, seed 1 + passphrase 2, seed 2 + passphrase 1, seed 2 + passphrase 2, overseas seed). 
* Store the passphrases only in your head (or possibly also in the head of a trusted friend who you're sure the government would not come after).
* Store one of the seeds in a private safe with some business you don't frequent and aren't associated with.
* Store another seed with a trusted friend you don't see often and isn't likely to be hassled by the government.
* Keep one of the hardware wallets in your home or on your person.
* Keep the other hardware wallet in another secure location (in a safe in yet another secure location different from these other things).
* The seed from a friend outside of the country should be created and managed by that friend. It really isn't your seed, but hopefully they will sign transactions when you ask them to.
* Tell anyone involved what to do in case of your arrest or disappearance/death.

This is all complicated and bothersome, but if you really think the government might come after you, it might be worth it. If you want to look at somewhat more well thought out guides on how to store your bitcoin securely, take a look at [The Tordl Wallet Protocols](https://github.com/fresheneesz/TordlWalletProtocols), which include guides for multisig wallets. There are a fair number of knobs, and the guide doesn't make any particular recommendations for what to do in totalitarian regimes, but it provides the pieces for you to put something together yourself."

Kraken has margin trading.  You could have done this in a way where you weren't left without BTC/USD exposure.  The way you do that is deposit a small amount of USD to Kraken ... e.g., $100.  Then using 4:1 leverage on your margin account, use that to buy $400 size LONG position of BTC.   Then at the same time sell $400 worth on Robinhood.  Withdraw and transfer the USD funds to Kraken, and then with that $400, buy a LONG position of size $1,600 of BTC.  Then at the same time sell $1,600 BTC on Robinhood.  WIthdraw that USD from Robinhood, then transfer to Kraken, and continue as above, until your Robinhood balance drops to zero.  Then convert your margined long to regular BTC and withdraw the BTC.   Your end result will be nearly the exact same quantity of BTC as your position size was on Robinhood at the beginning.   If you are not comfortable with 4:1 leverage, go to something more comfortable like 2:1, ... it just takes longer (i.e., more cycles of corresponding LONG on Kraken and SELL on Robinhood).

And for those that don't use Kraken (or an exchange with margin trading), there's a number of other derivative products that can be used for the same purpose:

Install (or buy - in case you're getting Bitcoin in Thousands of $) one or more of these wallets.

A few good wallet choices:

[https://blockstream.com/green/](https://blockstream.com/green/) \- Top Security Features, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://www.wasabiwallet.io/](https://www.wasabiwallet.io/) \- Excellent privacy, Open Source and Non-Custodial

[https://electrum.org](https://electrum.org/) \- Solid choice, Open Source and Non-Custodial, one of the oldest and most trusted Bitcoin Wallets.

Lightning wallets to consider (cheaper and faster transactions, great for very small amounts):

[https://phoenix.acinq.co/](https://phoenix.acinq.co/) \- Phoenix works on Android

[https://breez.technology](https://breez.technology/) \- Breez - Android or iOS

Hardware Wallets (to store larger amounts):

[https://trezor.io/](https://trezor.io/) \- Easy to use, no matter how new in Bitcoin you're.

[https://coldcardwallet.com/](https://coldcardwallet.com/) \- ColdCaard is currently the safest and most recommended here.

There's also Ledger, but I wouldn't recommend as not fully open source, keep and already leaked customers' details, etc. Whatever wallet you'll decide to buy, purchase DIRECTLY from the manufacturer, no eBay, no Amazon. Make sure the device is NOT preset, and you will generate your own seed words. This little device will hold the keys to your money, that's the reason why you have to be a bit more careful. Also, no worries, if it breaks, you can replace it - as long as you keep your seed words safe.

They want it private enough to attract institutions, but not private enough to enable transfers that they don't like (rough, generalizing description of course).

Think about it.

You have 1BTC, worth the value of the house you want today (whatever the price is).

Usually, you pay a house in 30 years with a credit.

If you RENT the house with your 1BTC, you will have 1BTC-amount each month.

In 30 years (remember, 1BTC was the whole value of your house 30 years ago) you will still have over 0.5BTC left as it appreciates.

Do not buy a house, just keep your 1BTC and rent it.

Neither will all these companies & investors that have come to the same conclusion: [https://bitcointreasuries.org/](https://bitcointreasuries.org/)

I recommend you get yourself a copy of ""The Bitcoin Standard"" by Saifedean Ammous. It explains the value proposition for bitcoin even better than I can.

We don't pine for it, we accept it. And we accepted it would take decades or generations, but the way 2020's been going we have had to accept it will be much faster now.

As for infrastructure, I guess you haven't heard that we've sent bitcoin over all kinds of infrastructure already. Even a carrier freaking pigeon. Blockstream's satellites have already made it so you can get fresh blocks for your node anywhere on the planet. You don't even need more than that to send coins from your wallet to someone elses' if they are in person. 

We already have great projects like [TxTenna](https://txtenna.com/) to take the network off-grid, and when we get real meshnet, like all of [these guys](https://emergentbydesign.com/2011/02/11/16-projects-initiatives-building-ad-hoc-wireless-mesh-networks/) are building, then nothing will be able to stop the rest of the network, not even global communications shutdown."

Id be careful it hasnt been tampered with (check seals)

Paper wallet is fine and equally safe for long term storage, it’s when you go to spend a paper wallet it is terrifying.
You cant just simply trust a wallet to not nab your private key so end up manually constructing a transaction from source to dest with an appropriate fee. Next get a dedicated clean linux laptop offline and somehow install some software you trust to sign your transaction with your private key.

Next use pen and paper or QR code to get the signed transaction back to an online computer.
(Dont use a usb as that could be compromised)
Now verify and reverify tx has right fees, destination and any flags. 
When you are super safe/happy you post it into the bitcoin network to be processed.

Clearly moving $500 this is overkill but moving $100,000 is terrifying when there is no undo or help line.
Doing it once, fine its a risk and a faff but ok.
Doing it to spend $100 out of your savings and not inadvertently putting the wrong mining fee or exposing a public key for the change address is just insane to do by hand.  Ie paper is safe for long term storage but when you want to spend even 1 satoshi you have to move everything so have a plan to do it safely.

A hardware wallet makes spending small and large amounts from savings an effortless and safe process, thats why they are well worth investing in."

After the sale is too late to ask for a refund address because it makes you a target for fake refund requests from non-customers. If you have the customer's refund address and the customer asks for a refund, then you evaluate the request and if it's valid, send the refund from your wallet to that refund address  

When a customer makes repeat orders, ask for a fresh refund address with each order. You can never be certain that the old refund address is still valid, still accessible to that customer  

You also need a policy which states the refund amount. Bitcoin's fiat exchange rate is sometimes volatile. Assuming you're cashing your Bitcoin as you receive it, and re-buying it for refunds, then the refund amount can be calculated according the the fiat value of the sale  

Refunding the Bitcoin amount of the sale works OK for you if you're not cashing the Bitcoin as it arrives, but is unfair to the customer if Bitcoin's exchange price has fallen since the sale"

There's more capital involved in a 10x dip from $100k that from $1k? 

And the ecosystem starts with more value when the price of bitcoin starts higher up?

I agree with these points but neither of them affect the fact that a 10x movement will have the same size on a log graph no matter the starting price before the drop. And neither affects the fact that as an investor all 10x drops will have the same affect on your holdings no matter the initial price, unless of course you have more value invested in one scenario due to your previous gains.

Could you further explain the point you're trying to make as i think we might be talking about two different things.

I'd suggest you just create your own ""family custodian"" wallet and send btc in a single tx split to 20 addresses there and label each address. Then make up nice gift cards and print the address/QR code for each kid and let them have that. 

They can monitor it and even create transactions (if they import it into a wallet) - you may even teach them with how to do that. They can send the tx to you to sign and broadcast (maybe even to their own real wallet). They have to take an active interest in it to take custody.

If that really doesn't work for you then setup an offline machine and use Electrum to create 20 wallets and write down the seed words for each kid on a nice gift card. Print out a QR code for each xpub so they can have watch-only wallets without needing to enter seed words. They'll probably get thrown in a drawer until maybe some day they remember and hopefully not screw it up trying to figure out how to use it.

With Electrum on the command line you can automate the wallet creation and data output (with a bit of effort reading the command docs). If you don't wipe everything after then you still basically have custody, and are a single point of compromise for all the wallets.

Addressing your points on money supply, this also quite confused me. So this is what I think and I am happy to be corrected. I think by holding money (i.e. cash in your wallet, checking accounts, savings accounts, etc.), you are in fact investing in money (and at least for savings account may receive a tiny amount of interest in the US).  The way it ""eats into money supply"" I think is simply reflected in the worth of that cash depreciating in terms of actual value (i.e. in relation to everything else, e.g. houses, cars, stocks, BTC) - in other words, inflation. The ""stock"" (amount) of cash and of bitcoin that exist in the world obviously do not change as a result of trading, they are neither created or destroyed via trading; simply the ratio of value between the two changes (e.g. the price of BTC in USD), representing how much of one (e.g. number of BTC coins) society is willing to exchange for another -- though this price is set at the margin (the last traded price)."

786705,g9y4t4n,t1_g9y3a0v,1603571647.0,jgkvrt,Bitcoin,1,False,False,"You are confused, the way inflation is calculated is different between the two.

USD is a debt based monetary system, USD are created in the system by interest charged on loans and credit, if the government needs money it issues bonds and more money is created.

Bitcoin is an asset based monetary system, there is a finite amount and what is in circulation is valued on the total amount available. 

We have had assets based monetary systems in the past (think of the gold standard when a dollar was equal to an amount of gold in the federal reserve).  The problem with a system like this is when more money needs to be created for example a government needs more, it has to share the new amount created amongst the total. This devalues all of the money currently in circulation. 

For example (figures made up just to explain concept). Let’s say a gold standard dollar in 1950 was worth 1 ounce of gold, then during the next funding that same dollar becomes worth 9/10ths if an ounce of gold and so on so forth until so much money has entered circulation a dollar is worth 0.000000001gram if gold. It eventually becomes worthless.

This is the same as bitcoin, you can go into 0.000000000000000001 of a bitcoin to value something but at that level it’s worthless. The current monetary system is designed to increase the value of a currency through steady inflation, growth in wages and general standard of living. Money is debt and when you pass it on you are passing the debts owed to you to someone else and so on so forth. The system works because of the belief that everyone will work and pay their debts. 

This is why national debt isn’t actually a problem until GDP drops, national debt could be infinity dollars but as long as the belief that the nation will work to pay towards its debt and it’s GDP is strong, then the system works."

The money I have put into BTC is all money I can stand to lose if I do, it will be a mild frustration. However I still do not see your point. Mass adoption has not happened yet, and as such you can not expect low transaction fees. When mass adoption happens and people start to want to buy candy bars with their btc then we will be at a point where transactional fees would come down. Either way you are acting as if $100 dollars on a $4000 dollar transaction is too much...it's not. The transaction fee even at 6% on a $2 purchase would be something around $.12 unless I am totally misunderstanding transaction fees. Which I'll admit is possible...but in all my transactions of bitcoin including some miniscule ones at the start of my purchasing, I have not paid any unreasonable transaction fees. 

You've made me see something though, and I am waiting on my tax refund now, I may split the money I was going to put into btc and put a chunk into eth now as well, so you've swayed me a bit, but I still think that you are wrong. I think that btc will far out travel eth, my geuss is that eth will become your ""walking around money"" and btc will serve as your savings.
