But we should also be mindful that BTC is a direct threat to the FIAT currency system of the world and the government authorities have a hate relation with BTC by default.

In this regard, I would like to present a worst-case scenario, and please do not misunderstand and assume that I am a BTC critic. I hold BTC  myself and would like a hike in the price.

 Assume if the government declares Bitcoin as illegal or imposes bans on cryptocurrency exchanges or banks refuse to take deposit/funds from cryptocurrency exchanges as HSBC is the first to do it?  

Please do not forget, and we know in recent past, that they made a law holding gold privately as an illegal act and imprisonable offence."

5520,go4mw1a,t1_go4jonu,1613836277.0,lo3lpc,CryptoMarkets,25,False,1613837533.0,"I repeat. Cryptocurrencies do not trade based on technical analyses. In fact they tend to defy technical analyses. When all signals point that a crypto should retract, they most often do the opposite. Bitcoin itself is a perfect example of this behavior. Cryptocurrency prices are extraordinarily speculative-- they are influenced primarily by manipulation by large holders of a given altcoin/token.

These large holders, typically called whales, also use high levels of leverage and margin trading, and they have the bankroll in BTC to back up their trades to move the markets they are in up or down on their own schedule. 

Second, price is influenced by hype generated by the development team, typically based on unrealized future ""milestones"" outlined in their published roadmap, milestones which are rarely if ever realized. 

Lastly, the price movements can be highly driven by the virtual media attention-driven demand a coin/token receives.

This is not my opinion. There have been detailed studies published on these markets and what moves them.

The charts simply do not matter 9 times out of 10. A coin can have an RSI on a 1 or 3 day interval in the mid to high 90s and yet still go on for days and double in price. Fundamentals drive these markets-- period.

They provide verification that message was created by a known person and the message was intact and not altered in transit.
