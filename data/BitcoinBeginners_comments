2) They are are ponzi scheme , create a sketchy ICO from nothing , steal your BTC and replace it for this ICO token to ""stake"" and earn interest where they can pay older investors with new victims . They need a constant supply of new investors or ""stakers"" in their scamcoin to keep the whole scheme going or everything falls apart

3) They are a straight up scam and will just steal your money

Another concern is they were hacked and now all their clients are targeted for phishing attacks , kidnapping, ransom and torture.

> stop a’ bad actor’ ie corporation/country from buying and destroying them for the purpose of reducing competition?

This would be the foolish attack on Bitcoin . Essentially such an attack would increase the value of Bitcoin to millions of dollars per Bitcoin , increase the security of Bitcoin tremendously, cost the attacker trillions of dollars to pull off and have 0 effect upon Bitcoins usability because Bitcoin can already be divided by 1/1000 of a satoshi or 13 decimal places and additional divisibility is trivial to add."

[Kraken is an exchange service](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030651871-What-is-Kraken-com-), not a wallet service. We provide clients the ability to deposit funds to our corporate wallet for safekeeping while the funds are being exchanged or used for trading, but we do not provide a personal wallet service.

As with most exchanges, funds sent to deposit addresses are moved to [cold storage and hot wallets](https://www.kraken.com/security/practices). While we do not recommend any particular wallets, hardware wallets do a great job of balancing usability with security for most mainstream users.

Ledger and Trezor are two of the most popular makers of hardware wallets.

[Here](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/categories/204677947-Getting-Started) you will find the essential information about how to get started with Kraken.

Let us know if you have any further questions, we will be happy to answer!

Have a nice weekend.

This is a valid question. Kraken does charge a [0.0005 btc fee](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000767986-Cryptocurrency-withdrawal-fees-and-minimums). 

Moving coins to different addresses on the blockchain incurs some type of miner compensation. The larger this compensation is, usually the more likely it is included in the next block. Other exchanges vary their withdrawal fees, additionally some wallets allow you to specify the fee you're willing to pay (e.g. the bitcoin core client)

The alternative is self control. Again, there have been many, many, many failures of this in the past as well. Lose password, password compromised, owner dies without providing access to heirs, etc.

>1) Lacks segwit so much higher transaction fees

>2) History of bugs and incompetence

>3) missing advanced features like RBF, lightning , or privacy features

>4) Is often used in insecure (osx/windows) desktop environments. IMHO you should only be using a wallet combined with a HW wallet in these environments. If you cant afford a 50 dollar HW wallet than just use a mobile wallet

>5) Is a popular wallet among scammers because of backdoor features and because it is easy to remotely setup

>6) Horrible bad security decisions like allowing users to setup wallets without forcing them first to copy and verify backup words

>7) History of privacy breaches from investors

And that's making me sweat a bit, like a gambler does.... I've not invested a penny of the family money though. That can safely depreciate in the bank, because losing that is simply not acceptable, and for me that's what it boils down to. 

Can't lose it all? Can't invest it."

No. Binance is a very risky exchange and might MtGox on us so if you use them never leave anything on there . Also their withdrawal fees are absurdly high at 0.0005 BTC (~15 euros )

Coinbase pro has lower withdrawal fees but for higher amounts you want to use something like Kraken

That being said, I’ve been devouring personal finance blogs and podcasts over the past 5 years and I’m convinced all the “teachings” about not letting a dip of any kind scare you into selling and, rather, see it as an opportunity to buy things on sale has set in. I started buying BTC at 47k and DCA all the way to 52k. Yesterday it was down below my initial buy-in and I’m actually happy. I want to see it go down even further during this dip because I have a nice chunk of cash in March I want to use to buy more. Don’t sweat the dips. Continue to DCA and HODL. Stay calm and BTC on. 😎"

Passphrase is a part of the (binary) seed, aka, master private key. It is a inseparable part of the seed/wallet. Both the mnemonic and the passphrase are used to generate the seed. Both are necessary to recreate the same wallet in other devices/apps.

When passphrase is not activated, an empty string is used as the passphrase. When you use a passphrase, which is different than an empty string, the seed will be different, therefore the wallet will be different.

You'll have to transfer your coins from your old wallet (the one without a passphrase) to your new one (the one with a passphrase). A fee will be incurred, unfortunately. If your old wallet isn't native SegWit (bech32, addresses beginning with ""bc1""), making the new wallet native SegWit will compensate for the fee."

For bitcoin to reach its present state, to generate 18m coins, took a lot of mathematical machine work. To get that last correct hash and countinue the blockchain is getting increasingly harder and it will take almost unimaginable power to one day finish it.

Thats the network everyone is talking about. TW of energy pumping into the final answer, final block. 

So when blockchain in a few years reaches the point where reward for next block is less than 1 btc, the amount of machine work required to mine it will demand the price increase. At least thats how I see it. Its blockchain is designed to require immense work to finish it and that work will generate immense value."

(I call it shitcoin roulette). In this year you will learn enough to see what and where you want to invest. You will know about centralisation, hash rate (51% attacks), open and neutral blockchains.

Don't daytrade:
 Welcome to the hardest game in the world.
Unfortunately, you're playing with some of the sharpest, fastest, most intelligent,
well informed, stubbornly irrational and in many cases, unethical minds in the world.

You're up against the computer that can react faster than you. 
The trader who has more experience than you. 
The fund that has more money than you. 
The insider that has more information than you. 
The others that will misinform you. 
The inner voice that will do it's best to undo you.

So, leave all your dreams of making quick and easy money, behind.

The first aim is survival. 
Your absolute first goal is to learn how to stay in the game.

You can only do this by mapping the territory. 
By understanding how the enemy thinks and acts. 
By having a solid game plan. 
And by picking your battles very, very carefully.

Whether I decide to spend directly from the exchange or to send it to my own wallet first and then spend it from there, there’s going to be a chance of transaction failure since it’s coming from an exchange. It could either fail from sending to recipient or sending to my wallet. At least that’s what I think, but I don’t have hands on experience on this. If this is true, I’d rather send directly from exchange to avoid the extra wallet step.

I know Bitcoin is not PayPal. I’m just trying to figure out alternatives that make sense for my use case."

KYC and ""anti money laundering"" basically don't work to stop crime or money laundering but have the very obvious and avoidable side effect of trapping billions of people in poverty. Furthermore these regulations give enormous power to unelected bureaucrats and feed a system of state surveillance that can be further abused by dictators.

I have Trezor Model T. But I like the idea of nano X.

But the difference is this:

- Trezor Model T does not have a built-in battery (its power comes from being plugged in), whereas nano X has with a lifespan of about 5 years.

- Trezor Models does not work on iOS, Ledger works on both android and iOS as well as Desktop using Bluetooth connectivity (as well as usb C plug for desktops and Android phones).

- Trezor is open source, Ledger is closed source.

- Both are the leading industries for Hardware Wallets.

I chose Trezor because I have iOS phone and therefore if I cant use it on my phone, then i do not want a battery built hardware wallet, its touchscreen is smooth and very secure compared to typing on laptop.

You can always recover your Bitcoins if your wallet gets deleted, only if you know your seed.

TO GET STARTED, you need to buy some bitcoin from a Bitcoin exchange. For beginners, I recommend the Cash App for its 2% purchase fees and free withdrawals. Once you buy Bitcoin, withdraw it to a non custodial Bitcoin wallet. This is a wallet where you control the private keys that control your Bitcoin. Don't leave your Bitcoin on an exchange. 

Not your keys, not your coins. Bitcoin is the freedom from needing banks and governments to transfer digital money. Do not use a custodial Bitcoin wallet. Don't put your Bitcoin into someone else's hands. Hold it yourself in a non custodial wallet. Always withdraw your Bitcoin from the exchange where you bought it.
 
I recommend using [Mycelium Bitcoin wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet) for Android.

Make sure to write down your 12 word restore phrase. It can restore your Bitcoin on any device. So keep it safe and secure. No pictures. No typing into a file. Pen and paper only. This phrase essentially IS your Bitcoin because control of your money is unlocked with it. 

Never sell your Bitcoin. Just spend it when you want to take profit. Selling Bitcoin on exchanges lowers the price per Bitcoin. So just spend it directly like how it's supposed to work.

When spending or transferring your Bitcoin, there's a transaction fee. (The fee goes to the Bitcoin miner who mines the block that contains that transaction). 

Check https://mempool.space/ to see how low to set your transaction fee. You'll set the transaction fee when sending a payment from your Bitcoin wallet. Some wallets don't offer this option. Don't use those wallets.

And finally, a warning from Jameson Lopp. ""Every bitcoin that is held by an institution is a bitcoin that has had its security weakened by being subjected to bureaucratic and political decision-making. “Not your keys, not your bitcoin” rings true because when you have to ask someone for permission to transact, you are no longer in a position to resist censorship. Bitcoin owners must not trust third parties to act in their best interest!""

Hold your own Bitcoin. Don't let anyone trick you into giving them your Bitcoin. All of those schemes are Ponzi schemes. Nobody is going to give you interest on your Bitcoin, and if they do, they're paying you in a worthless, flawed token. Or they are doing accounting shenanigans that Bitcoin already solved. They will all collapse, and people with think they lost their Bitcoin, when in reality the Bitcoin was lost as soon as you deposited it into the Ponzi scheme. 

Not your keys, not your coins."

3581,gov17kc,t3_lswsbc,1614363622.0,lswsbc,BitcoinBeginners,3,False,False,"I keep seeing and reading all of these brilliant (and not so brilliant) analyses that completely miss the big picture. Bitcoin has effectively taken on the role of digital gold. And I do not mean gold in the sense of hyperbole, I mean in the sense of a fixed quantity anchor for measurable economic value.

When it becomes effectively impossible to mine new bitcoin, the only useful measurement of value will be trading on the relative value of bitcoin (in the general pool of other hard assets) compared to global M2 fiat. The biggest question is what portion of global M2 fiat will be ""stored"" in BTC, and what will the global M2 supply look like in 2030.

So we have to ask another question, which state actors control the vast bulk of actual ""fixed"" crypto tokens and the computer systems that process the transactions? China? Probably. That's not necessarily good or bad, but it sets up questions as to who can potentially manipulate the fiat/crypto conversion market.

In a perfect world, every fiat would be tied to some immutable anchor. Physical gold, crypto, whatever. But that's probably just a lurid fantasy.

Prove me wrong on something here, but every analysis I read seems to tie the value of BTC to some sort of computing cost, which we know is approaching a practical asymptotic limit. In the very near future, there will be *no new BTC*, so tying the long term value to that limit fails to ask the question ""Then what?""

There's a big macroeconomic principal here in play, that there is actually no such thing as new value, only new opportunities to shift value from one place to another. People like to pretend that if you dig up an ounce of gold, for example, that you somehow created new money. But in reality, someone has to BUY that ounce of gold, so you only moved some temporary economic value from their pocket into yours, by offering something they want.  In this case, an immutable asset. You have worked (quite hard in fact) to dig up, refine, measure, and offer in trade, a symbolic storage unit of economic value that cannot be simply conjured out of thin air at the whim of any one group of people (such as fiat currency, and it's endlessly bloated futures derivatives, for example).  


So is BTC a real, universally agreed, immutable token of economic value? Well at roughly 1% of global M2 (best current estimate) BTC is now representing about 10% of the amount of fiat that is currently symbolically tied to physical gold.  


Considering one can rather easily move a billion dollars of actual 'immutable' BTC code/tokens to anywhere in the world and convert them to any partial or whole portion of fiat with \**relative\** simplicity, and one cannot easily move or subsequently sell a billion dollars of actual physical gold, it has a very solid case to be easily 10X it's current value (gold is currently representing roughly 10% of global M2).  


Last caveat, what we are seeing now is sort of a global land rush for the crypto economy, and it will likely be ten years or so until we see a sifting and settling into two separate practical uses, transactional and accepted-immutable. Transactional tokens will serve a purpose, deriving value from their use in contracts and transactions, this will be fundamentally determined by their individual security, usefulness, and simplicity.  Immutable crypto will be a simple store of value.  Creating more crypto types 'should' eventually be universally accepted as frivolous dilution and generally ignored by the major controlling networks and actors. (no real effect on major token values)

When you buy a long term crypto asset, ask: is it an institutionally accepted immutable token, transactional-useful (and with a long-term viable structure!) or just more land-rush (""Buy cheap land in Florida!"") dilution (aka sh\*tcoins) that will probably evaporate from lack of institutional adoption.  


If it is in fact ""real"" now, then you cannot fail by holding it. No different from owning a 24k gold ring (however tiny) or a natural diamond (however large)."

Like I said though keep money aside to buy the dip. So if you can afford to spend $20 a week on buys try setting up a recurring buy for $10 a week, save that extra $10 week to start building a lump sum amount, then if you see the market drop use that savings to buy in.

The signature is specific to the transaction being signed, as well as the private key making the signature. The transaction is a ""message"". The private key signs the message

In asymmetric signature cryptography, there is no limit to the signatures a private key can create

I felt a little apprehensive encouraging them to jump in, but would also feel bad not giving them info that could potentially help their futures.  In encouraging others on whether or not to buy Bitcoin, I think I've finally landed somewhere in the thinking that with the potential upside being so insanely high, and the potential downside of losing everything we've put in being something we CAN survive (keeping liquid assets high enough for emergencies etc): Would you be more upset about losing the $10k, or however much you might choose to invest, COMPLETELY or more upset if/when a Bitcoin is worth $400k and each of your dollars would be worth 12.845x what it is now (Bitcoin price being currently $31,140), but you didn't get in?

2) ETH is an illegal security according to the Howey test with a premine of 72 million eths. They purposely misled investors by suggesting merely 12 million gifted premine ignoring the 60 million they sold. Misleading total supply graphs in their prospectus. This is a serious concern in light of Ripple getting sued by the SEC as being an illegal security which means in due time we should expect them to also go after ethereum developers and the ethereum foundation for creating an illegal security

3) Vitalik and many other have been falsely representing Ethereum and misleading others over and over again. example - pitching turing completeness as the valuable aspect of ETh , now pivoting away from that and saying it was never about turing completeness but ""rich statefulness""

4) Ethereum is a pointless project that will lead to no efficiency because there is no censorship risk in code execution. If a project has no hope of ever creating an efficiency(like bitcoin has found with regulatory arbitrage) than every company and project will ultimately fail in its ecosystem. Are you trying to suggest that someday in the future there will be censorship risk in code execution? If not than what purpose does Ethereum solve if it comes with a horrible tradeoff of an extremely large attack surface and huge scaling problems?

5) Advertising immutability and unstoppable contracts that were than immediately reversed with multiple hard forks. 

6)	For goodness sake the inflation distribution rate or final algo is not even defined and people are investing in this. This is insane and basically amounts to faith in vitalik and his team, while at the same time newbs are misled into believing eth is decentralized.

7)	Ethereum has already failed to scale as expected and so they are creating a whole new blockchain and starting from scratch soon. This second attempt won’t do any better than the first IMHO.

8) the fact that ethereum is switching over to staking rewards has serious tax implication in many countries where merely holding your eth unlike bitcoin being staked will expose you to taxes. Coinbase for example files 1099MISC for any staking over 600 usd a year to the IRS

All you need to understand:

**The declining BTC mining rewards are in reality a shift from an inflation-financed network to a transaction-financed network.**

The halvings have absolutely no consequences for mining profitability (in dollar terms). New coin emission goes down, Bitcoin price goes up. It's that simple.

> Good examples of blockchain use cases

The ""we use blockchain"" hype is all fraud. There are no applications for blockchain. I could write 5000 words on this, but it has been discussed to death here and elsewhere for the past 3 or 4 years. Blockchain is a minor element of Bitcoin's design, is not useful for anything outside the context of Bitcoin as a system of components. As a whole, the Bitcoin system supports Bitcoin's purpose

> Using physical concepts to refer to electronic/decentralized things

Metaphors are always inaccurate, but they make people believe they understand something

> Little discussion of the wallet itself

Right. I've seen 10 posts in this subreddit today, where ""investors"" wanting to ""get into"" Bitcoin are asking where to get a Bitcoin account. Bitcoin does not have accounts  

**Bitcoin is like cash in your pocket**  

This goes down like a lead balloon. On the one hand, that's the genius of Satoshi's work, an Internet system analogous to cash in your pocket. On the other hand, speculation greed attracts millions of people with a one-track view. It's the Internet. I have to sign up with a username, password, email address and three personal questions to help with account recovery  

On the third hand, occasionally someone wants to actually use Bitcoin to buy something. Install a free wallet app, buy Bitcoin, put it in your wallet (use the Receive button), spend it (use the Send button). It's just like cash in your pocket  

This cognitive dissonance persists where people believe Bitcoin is an investment asset to make a lazy profit. They don't want cash in the pocket. That's like cash under the bed. Keep it in the warm and fuzzy giant corporation where a forgotten password is forgiven by answering the three personal questions  

You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink. If the speculators want to leave all their coins on the next Mtgox, they deserve to lose their coins. Don't blame the teacher if the student is too stubborn to learn

> And for hot wallets, the fact that exchanges / websites are technically the holders of your info

An exchange account is not a wallet. Exchanges keep promoting themselves as wallets, incorrectly. I'm not sure what videos you're watching, but there's nothing in any FAQ or reputable blog which refers to an exchange as a hot wallet

> Little discussion of value fluctuations

Price is not the same as value. The price bubble defies discussion, because it is 100% irrational. Believing Bitcoin is a trading asset is delusional. A few years ago, a community of penny stock pump and dump scammers discovered Bitcoin as an asset to manipulate for profit. Their bubble is temporary

> In discussing anonymity, movies and news posts gloss over fact that all wallets and transactions are public

You're buying into a fake dichotomy between two extremes  

*    Bitcoin transactions are all anonymous  

*    Bitcoin transactions can be traced all the way back  

The nuance is documented thoroughly in the privacy page  
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Privacy  

> but you can infinitely trace all transactions to and from that wallet

That's bullshit. Bitcoin only stores a one-step link, from a transaction input back to the older transaction output it is spending. Any other link is an assumption, a guess, frequently wrong. Read the privacy page

> Some places don’t explain the fractions of a Bitcoin exist

It only takes 5 seconds of research to discover this. Again, whenever someone wants to spend Bitcoin, they already know it can be used to buy something on-line for $80. Only the so-called ""investors"" get stuck for not knowing there are 100 million Satoshis in a Bitcoin. Do you expect every financial article to explain that there are 100 cents in a dollar? Spoon feeding only goes so far

> when it should strictly say “worth USD $X at time of sale/trade/date.”

Segwit and native segwit are two different kinds of addresses. When Bitcoin started all the addresses started with a ""1."" In segwit all the addresses start with a ""3"" and native segwit they all start with ""bc1."" 

Segwit was a big improvement to the Bitcoin protocol back in 2017 before the end of the big bull run that year. To make it short and sweet, it's lighter weight and makes transaction fees lower. Native segwit was an improvement to this.

You can actually make multiple Bitcoin wallets in ledger so you can have both a segwit and native segwit wallet.

So you are a lot more flexible with the ledger.

Shameless self-plug here: Our wallet, called ""AirGap"", is very similar to Ellipal, but the whole code is open source and you can install the ""Vault"" (the secure offline app holding your keys) on an old phone (and then put it into airplane mode).

With each private key you can then generate one public key and with each public key you can generate an address. This you can generate seed -> privkey -> pubkey -> address but not the other way around. There is one public key for one private key and there is one address for one public key (although collision is possible because there are less addresses than public keys).

What you perhaps mean are extended private keys and extended public keys. The way keys are generate in wallet usually follows a certain path. This is because there are almost infinetly many possibilities to generate keys and there had to be a standard amonst wallets. With your seed you can generate an extended private key and from this an extended public key. With the extended private key you can generate more private keys and public keys down the derivation path, with the extended public key you can only generate the corresponding public keys, which is nice if for example you want a watch-only wallet on your smartphone for your hardware wallet, that way you can see all transactions made from your hardware wallet, even if it generates new addresses."

There are many aspects of security. Some can be absolutely secure. 128 bits of entropy, for example, is absolutely secure if quantum computer turns out to be ineffectual. Otherwise, 256 bits of entropy is absolutely secure.

By choosing lower than 128 (it's actually somewhere between 100 and 110, IIRC) bits of entropy, you are giving up absolute security on this aspect.

Correct me if I'm wrong, because I haven't been at this for long,  but unless crypto collapses and value of BTC drops to zero, the losses are temporary as long as you don't sell.  So if you buy 10K of BTC at $50K, and the next day the price resets and drops down to 41K, all you have to do is wait for the price to go up again. The only way you lose that 9K is if you sell at 41K, or if BTC never goes up again.

With the entire world jumping in, chances are any losses/price drops at this point will be short lived.

Example figures only:
If you decide to buy at $10,000, buy at $10,000. Do not wait for it to drop to $8,000 because then it might spike to $12,000, meaning you either have to pay $2,000 more, or wait for it to potentially drop again, which it might not, costing you even more.

The same goes for selling. Say you’ve bought at $10k, now you’ve said you’ll sell at $25k. Bitcoin hits $25k and you think “I’ll just hang on a bit longer until $30k”, overnight Bitcoin tanks to $15k and you miss out on $10k per coin. That extra $10k could’ve bought you another coin, which might be worth 250k in the coming years. Who knows? Bitcoin is being considered a very safe investment, however.

Additionally, never spend more than you can afford to lose. Bitcoin could lose its value overnight and never regain it, meaning you’ve lost everything you invested in it. Be prepared for the absolute worst.

And I predict Bitcoin will see another few drops down below its current price (AU$25k) to below AU$15k. Get in as low as you can, but don’t wait too long. Bitcoin is predicted to spike considerably in 2021 and only continue from there."

part of the problem is you are using legacy addresses which leads to higher fees. You need to enable that feature in the settings and send your complete balance over to an address that starts with bc1 to realize the benefit of segwit. 

brd should have that upgrade enabled by default IMHO. 

>What do you mean ""Sats a byte"" - noob here?

with bitcoin you choose the fee . the fee is denominated in sats a byte and based mostly on the size of the transaction(not in value but size in data.) 

The correlation between larger txs(thus larger tx fees) has more to do with dust (you received many small txs into your wallet instead of a single one) and nothing to do with the value of the tx directly (although very valuable txs typically are larger because they need to cover multiple inputs to fund the total amount, but not necessarily)

Thus a tx of 1 million usd in BTC can technically have a lower tx fee (because the weight/size is smaller ) than a BTc tx worth 50 USD (because its filled with dust)

As you can see here from a fee scraper -

https://twitter.com/CoreFeeHelper

You can pay a few pennies to send Bitcoin. Most merchants accept 0 confirmation txs thus the only people that typically need to overpay are those that are day traders and sending bitcoin to an exchange in a time sensitive matter. This is all for onchain transactions, and most people will not be spending bitcoin in the future this way. more than half my transactions already are with a lightning wallet and my fees are a fraction of a penny and i get an instant confirmations"

Is it safe to use a paper wallet from ATM, while considering what if I coulden't be able to send this purchased Bitcoin from paper-wallet to my e.g. on the mobile installed software wallet or Hardware wallet's like Trezor-T? I wanted to say, if I use my mobile wallet on anonymous internet will it be more safer regarding I will definately receive the Bitcoin that I purchased, as I can see it in my wallet in my mobile phone, but may paper wallet may have problem in sending money to the on the mobile installed software wallet or hardware wallet(e.g Trezor-T), or the paper wallets are as safe as the on the mobile installed software wallet or hardware wallet in this case?

In the end, neither method is as good as the proponents offer; neither is as bad as the opponents claim.  It all depends on underlying assumptions, risk tolerance, tolerance to market volatility, how much you are able to invest and when.

Over time, a lump sum investment will outperform dollar cost averaging every time.  The basic reason: the sooner you invest, the longer your investment has to work for you.  Example:

**Assumptions**

* Today:  $40K/BTC
* Annual Growth Rate:  25%
* Investment:  You find $1K on the ground (i.e. - “free money”)
* Strategy:  DCA yearly or “lump sum” and HODL

**Lump Sum**

If you invest the full $1K on day one at $40K/BTC, you will have $1,953 at the end of year three.

**DCA**

You make a yearly average investment of $333.33 per year, at the end of year three will have $1,589 ($365 less).  This is due simply to the fact that you waited to invest the balance of the $1K you found and lost out on the compound growth rate.

**Commentary**

The example above assumes that you don’t need the $1K to put food on your table, pay your rent/mortgage, etc.  This is where I think DCA shines.  DCA is for persons who can’t lump sum invest.  

Pick a frequency that is convenient and an amount that you can afford.  The example above proves that investing sooner is better than investing later; therefore:

* monthly is better than yearly
* bi-weekly is better than monthly
* weekly is better than bi-weekly
* daily is better than bi-weekly
* hourly is better than daily and…
* you get the picture.

Personally, a DCA schedule of daily sounds like a major pain in the ass.  What do I do?  I use both methods

* DCA - Every two weeks  after payday on my off friday (nice cup of coffee with my BTC)
* Lump Sum - If my parents gift me money and I don’t need it for something else (i.e.- free money), I buy BTC ASAP... don't wait.
* Enjoy life too:  The Xmas money my parents gave me this year was used to buy a nice bottle of whiskey to taste while learning more on r/BitcoinBeginners"

GPU mining ended in early 2013 for bitcoin. You should only mine BTC if you do at least 100 hours of research - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=14.0 As mining is very professional

Understand difficulty https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty

Avoid cloud mining (Most are ponzis, fractionally reserve mine, or charge too high fees = you will never ROI). In some jurisdictions cloud mining is considered an illegal security as well http://2hsvz0l74ah31vgcm16peuy12tz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/01621904.pdf
